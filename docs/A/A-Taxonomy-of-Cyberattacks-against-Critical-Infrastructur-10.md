## CONCLUSION

Cybercrime and cyberterrorism are issues of growing concern, yet not much has been done to address the problem and provide mechanisms for more adequate incident identification and response. We witness cyberattacks every day and if we have credit cards or have shopped in some of the most popular chains, we have already been victims of these attacks. They are especially threatening when it comes to critical infrastructure and national security. Thus, as a society we need to put more pressure on policy makers to address these concerns and provide more effective and adequate regulations to reduce cybercrime and respond to incidents. If as a nation we demonstrate that we do not tolerate these types of crimes, it will send a clear sign to hackers and any individuals with malicious intents that there are severe consequences to their actions. We can start this process by leveraging the Routine Activity Theory and focusing on strengthening our security posture as individuals, corporations, and nation.

The taxonomy we propose in this study is a good first step in addressing this important issue and providing researchers and practitioners with the tools necessary to better understand the challenging environment of cyberterrorism and cybercrime. While there may be many hurdles to proactively addressing the problem such as lack of adequate policies, regulations, resources to investigate these attacks, multiple jurisdictions, and complicated extradition policies, it is our duty to provide better guardianship of critical infrastructure facilities and ensure that we have implemented all the necessary controls to reduce cybercrime and cyberterrorism and that if these crimes were to happen, we will be ready to respond to them.
