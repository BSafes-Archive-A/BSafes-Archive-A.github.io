## Appendix B
Informed Consent
A Study about Antisemitism and Jewish Identity

Dear Participant,
You are invited to participate in the present study on the relationship between Jewish identity and experiences with antisemitism. More specifically, the principal investigator hopes to learn more about the relationship between Jewish identity and antisemitism and Jewish denomination and antisemitism. Furthermore, I hope to find out what type of antisemitism (i.e. ethnic, religiously based, or anti-Zionism) Jewish individuals tend to experience most often.

You were selected to participate in this study because you self-identify as Jewish and live in the U.S. If you decide to participate, please complete the following set of questions. The survey is designed to measure Jewish identity (i.e. religious and/or ethnic aspects) as well as experiences with antisemitism. It will take about 30 minutes to complete the survey. You will be asked to answer questions about your Jewish affiliation, as well as Jewish traditions and practices you keep. Additionally, you will be asked to answer questions about your personal experiences with and thoughts about antisemitism. You may experience some discomfort as you reflect on your personal experiences with discrimination. If you need support you may contact the NAMI helpline at 800-950-NAMI.

You will not directly benefit from this research. However, you may benefit from this study indirectly by contributing to the counseling field’s awareness and knowledge regarding Jewish issues, such as antisemitism.

Data will be collected using the Internet. While there are no guarantees on the security of data sent on the Internet, I will maximize confidentiality by not collecting your name or any other personal data such as birthday or social security number. I recommend that you use your personal computer to complete this study rather than an employer-issued device. Your right to privacy will remain intact as the computer used to input data for statistical analysis will be password protected and only used by the principal investigator. The information obtained may be used for future research and publications.

If you choose to participate, you have the right to stop at any time. You may skip questions you do not want to answer.

If you have any questions pertaining to this study feel free to contact me directly at ambrosiusm1@montclair.edu. You can also contact my Faculty Advisor,

Dr. Dana Heller Levitt, at levittd@montclair.edu.

Any questions about your rights may be directed to Dr. Katrina Bulkley, Chair of the Institutional Review Board at Montclair State University at reviewboard@mail.montclair.edu or 973-655-5189.

The Institutional Review Board at Montclair State University as has approved this study # IRBFY18-19-1263

Thank you for your time.
