## Levels of VR implementation
With the increase of virtual reality content available via mobile applications and the internet (e.g., 360 images and videos), VR is no longer limited to those with high-end VR hardware and software. Although sophisticated VR hardware and software are ideal for a fully immersive VR experience, low-tech options, such as mobile devices and cardboard headsets, provide a viable entry-point for utilizing virtual reality in the classroom. Due to this increased access to VR content and options for how users engage with this content, it is easier for students to access VR content on their own devices. These factors help reduce the cost and access barriers previously associated with VR, help address the needs of varying learners, and provide options for educators to utilize this technology in face-to-face and online courses.

The wide range of hardware and software options can make it difficult for educators to determine where to start and how to effectively utilize VR with students. When thinking about how VR could be utilized in a course, it is important to start by identifying the resources available and the level to which VR can be implemented. For the purposes of this paper, three levels of VR implementation have been identified: Level 1: VR Lite, Level 2: Immersive VR, and Level 3: Custom+ Immersive VR. Each of the three levels is described in detail below, starting with a bring-your-own device model ranging to more sophisticated hardware and software. (Refer to Image 1.1 below for more details).

Image 1.1: Levels of VR Implementation

Level 1: VR Lite, involves the use of existing and commonly available hardware (e.g., mobile devices, laptops) and existing VR software (e.g., free or low cost). In this VR lite level, students view VR content using via mobile applications (free or paid) or free, browser-based experiences (e.g., 360 images and videos). This level provides the most flexibility in how the VR content is accessed and viewed since students may use a laptop or mobile device with no additional hardware to view the content, or students may use a mobile device in conjunction with a free or low-cost cardboard headset to make the experience more immersive. While this level is the least immersive of the three levels of implementation, it provides a low cost, flexible approach that supports the needs of varying learners. As a result, VR Lite is a viable option to implement VR in both in-person and distance learning courses. The strategies and resources presented in this paper will focus on implementing this Level 1:VR Lite.

Level 2: Immersive VR, is when existing VR software is utilized with VR headsets of higher quality than cardboard headsets. The higher quality VR headsets come at a greater cost than cardboard headsets but provide students with a more immersive experience and may also involve enhanced audio elements and movement (e.g., hand controls, walking). It is likely that the higher quality VR headset would need to be accessed on campus in a shared physical space and would limit this experience to in-person class interactions. One possible scenario may be to use a combination of Level 1 and 2 if the budget and course modality support this.

Level 3: Custom + Immersive VR, involves the use of high-end VR hardware and access to custom-built VR experiences. Some institutions may have access to a team of programmers and designers who can build unique VR experiences specific to course learning goals. Due to the cost and resources required for this level of VR implementation, this is the least common scenario for the majority of educators at this point in time.
