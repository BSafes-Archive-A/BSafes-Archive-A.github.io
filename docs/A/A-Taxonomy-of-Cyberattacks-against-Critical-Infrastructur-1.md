## INTRODUCTION
Cybercrime is a problem of growing significance in society. This is partially due to the mass integration of technology not just in our everyday lives, but also in critical government infrastructure. The overreliance of technology has created a new opportunity for hackers and other individuals with malicious intentions to take advantage and compromise systems and breach databases with sensitive information that may pertain to national security, individuals’ medical, financial, educational, personal, etc. records. When it comes to critical infrastructure such as power plants, nuclear facilities, electric grid, dams, they are especially vulnerable to attacks because they were built predominantly before today’s cybersecurity standards. These growing opportunities combined with the increased motivation and resources that hackers have, make our society an easy target of cybercrimes.

Specifically, cyberterrorism and information warfare demonstrate in practice the massive impact of malicious attacks. While such attacks may not be as frequent as other types of cybercrimes like cyberstalking, cyberbullying, identity theft or data breaches, they have the capability to potentially take down entire countries’ infrastructures and paralyze critical resources. Such attacks are often state-funded and categorized as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Thus, it is vital to focus on this growing threat to national security and consider new approaches to better protect individuals and government structures and identify means to respond to incidents.

A significant first step in this direction would be to analyze the hacker culture and understand why these individuals commit cybercrimes in the first place. Attacking the root cause of the problem is the only viable solution to reduce cybercrimes in the future. While some hackers may be motivated by financial gain, others commit crimes for social or political reasons. By focusing on these different types of offenders, we can propose more adequate solutions to policy makers because one single policy may not be able to adequately resolve all these problems.
