## Conclusion and the Path Forward
Internal politics and contemporary economic frameworks from Manila characterize an inclination towards global interconnectivity and FDI. Though disparaging remarks from the Duterte administration have arisen, investment through internal and external means maintains a distinguished goal of Manila's governance. As China increases its investment abroad through BRI projects, cooperation between Beijing and Manila will proliferate (though growing social straining and territorial disputes may impede these efforts). The rise of China in the Philippines’ politics should not be an invitation for Washington to distance itself from Manila, but rather an invitation for the United States to extend its own developmental faculties in the nation.

As mentioned previously, projects such as the City of Pearl and New Clark City are not holistically unilateral. Increased engagement has the potential to lay the groundwork for the empowering of both countries’ economies, a step towards victory in the war on terror, and increased leverage for both countries in the global market. With engagement and friendship prioritized, the framework for a stronger Philippine-United States relationship may advance through the means of common prosperity for the peoples of both nations.
