## Discussion
The influence of the internet on healthcare systems and on public health is likely to continue to grow and expand, especially in quarantine periods. Although a small proportion of those seeking health-related information online may indeed be cyberchondriacs, many, if not most, may have legitimate undertreated symptoms [46]. The construct of cyberchondria refers to a pattern of dysfunctional behavior occurring in patients facing preoccupations related to their state of health, showing excessive restlessness, anguish and dysfunctional behavior due to their compulsive research for online information [35,47-49]. This disorder seems to be associated to other symptomatology, although with some differences, such as health anxiety disorder, compulsive obsessive disorder, pathological internet abuse [50,51]. The examined literature suggests how constantly searching for online health-related information increases anxiety levels, and the Covid-19 pandemic created an infodemic, with excessive, and unfounded information (fake news); the public being bombarded with vast quantities of information, most of which not being scientifically correct, and the social media manipulating the public opinions. Therefore, the individuals may be misinformed by the social media, which exacerbates fears of COVID-19, cyberchondria and other mental health problems [52-55]. The relationships between cyberchondria and internet abuse, as demonstrated in the literature, are significant (Rs=0.59) compared to other constructs, although even this would seem relatively independent from cyberchondria [14]. According to Hashemi et al., (2020) cyberchondria is directly associated with metacognitive beliefs, anxiety sensitivity, and indirectly associated with fear of COVID19 [2]. Cyberchondria represents a potentially important avenue for research in the context of chronic pain, individuals with chronic pain being often anxious about their health due to the uncertainty about the origin of their pain problems [33,46,56]. The construct of uncertainty intolerance has been highlighted in patients with pathologies in the quarantine period, thus revealing how intolerance to uncertainty determines an increase in the use of internet in order to look for health-related information and, thus, an increase in health anxiety [17,26,39,57]. Therefore, the information obtained online can increase uncertainty about health, perhaps ultimately leading to cyberchondria in individuals who have greater difficulty in tolerating uncertainty [14,58]. Moreover, it is important that public healthcare workers maintain clear lines of communication with the people quarantined about what to do if they experience any symptoms. The pattern of associations with compulsion highlighted a suppression effect, as controlling for inhibitory intolerance to uncertainty led to the association between prospective intolerance of uncertainty and compulsion to be negative in direction [11,59,60]. In other words, cyberchondria not only refers to looking for health information online, but it involves excessive research that is driven by and/or leads to distress and anxiety [61].
