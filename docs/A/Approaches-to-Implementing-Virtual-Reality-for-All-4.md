## Strategies to Address Accessibility Issues
As mentioned above, there are a variety of accessibility issues to consider when planning the implementation of VR in your course. It is difficult for educators to address all of these. Below is a list of strategies to apply when planning and testing the implementation of VR to help identify possible accessibility issues and consider accommodations for students who may need them.

- Test the technology yourself. If possible, test accessing the VR content using different devices (e.g., laptop, mobile device, with or without cardboard headset). Note the physical movements, visual or auditory queues you may need to follow when engaging with the VR content.

- If possible, provide options on how students view the VR content rather than requiring the use of a VR headset. 

- Be aware of your students' limitations. 

- Provide clear directions for students on how to access the VR content and the steps you would like them to take. 

- Include safety tips, such as sitting when starting and finding a space with enough room to engage with VR, in the directions for your VR activity. 

- Pair students up or consider having students work in groups if in a shared physical space.

- Allow students with low vision to use higher end VR headsets if available, since these may help improve vision. 

- Test physical movements that are required when viewing a 360 image:
    - Computer keyboard/mouse
    - Mobile device
    - Hold a VR headset and move your head

- Try using the keyboard arrows to see if they can be used to access a VR product.
