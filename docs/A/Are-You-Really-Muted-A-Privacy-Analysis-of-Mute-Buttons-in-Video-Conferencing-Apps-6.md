## 6 Discussion
In the following, we discuss some of the limitations with our methodology. We also discuss possible mitigation strategies, including an improved OS-level permission model and user education.

### 6.1 Limitations of the Study
Using live binary analysis tools, we developed a technique to trace incoming audio data from the microphone driver to the operating system’s socket API; our methods are in compliance with each app’s Terms of Service (ToS). We conducted a thorough evaluation of the Webex native Windows app, demonstrating that we could distinguish a variety of background activities that were most commonly reported in our user study. We discuss limitations in (1) our binary analysis techniques, (2) our dataset and (3) our background activity classifier.

The first limitation is that our binary analysis technique does not easily generalize to other apps because different VCAs have different mechanisms for preparing and encrypting network traffic. Many of the apps we studied encrypt the outgoing data stream before passing it to the operating system’s socket interface, making it impossible to search the binary’s memory image for the raw microphone data. Only in Webex were we able to intercept plaintext immediately before it is passed to the Windows network socket API.

The second limitation is that the findings from the user study might not generalize to the general population. The user study participants are young and educated professionals, who are potentially more tech-savvy than the general population. However, the responses to our questions did not reveal a high level of technical sophistication when describing the operation of the mute button. Fig. 3 shows that handful of participants were able to correctly describe the operation of the mute button.

The third limitation is that we collected data for our Webex case study in only one room. We do not consider the impacts of the speaker’s volume level or the room’s acoustic properties that may affect the microphone input. It may be possible to infer a relationship between the room’s acoustic properties and the audio statistics that Webex reports using raw audio data acquired while the app is unmuted.

The six classes include Classical Music (cm), Cooking or eating (ck), Talking (tk), Dog Barking (dg), Keyboard (kb), Vacuum or Cleaning (vc).](https://statics.bsafes.com/images/papers/Are-You-Really-Muted-A-Privacy-Analysis-of-Mute-Buttons-in-Video-Conferencing-Apps-fig-9.png)

**Fig. 9.** Background activity classifier performance with window length = 7. The six classes include Classical Music (cm), Cooking or eating (ck), Talking (tk), Dog Barking (dg), Keyboard (kb), Vacuum or Cleaning (vc).

Finally, our classifier targets single background activity at a time, and it does not perform well on all background activities. Differentiating between multiple sources is potentially possible, however, due to a limited data collection scheme we did not evaluate multiple simultaneous events. Furthermore, the “cooking” background activity shows a low accuracy score and overlaps with “keyboard” data points in Fig. 8. Poor performance of the cooking class appears to be caused by inconsistent noises that are generated by different cooking activities like grilling, frying, baking, etc. Another reason for the poor performance is that cooking and typing sound similar at different distances. Also, our data does not account for noises that are short in duration. Sounds need to last at least a single minute to create a data point; our techniques cannot evaluate unique but short noises.

### 6.2 An OS-Level Mitigation
To ensure a trustworthy permission model for microphone access in VCAs, we suggest that operating systems adopt a “software mute” feature similar to the one implemented in Chromium and WebRTC. Under that model, the VCA calls an API function or syscall in the OS to disable audio traffic flowing from the microphone driver to the app, putting the OS in charge of the microphone data while the app is muted.

The OS’s microphone status indicator would serve as an easy and nontechnical mechanism for users to audit VCAs, ensuring that they use the software mute correctly. The microphone status indicator should be on only when the VCA is unmuted and off otherwise. In our analysis of mute button, we found that the operating system cannot detect the state of an app-controlled mute button, and consequently the microphone status indicator does not correctly reflect whether the VCA is actively reading data from the microphone driver. Since the mute functionality is currently implemented in the VCA instead of the OS, there is no clear policy about how microphone data should be handled during mute that applies to every VCA. As we discovered, some apps read from the microphone at a lower data rate during mute, but Webex reads from the mic the same way regardless of mute button status.

An OS-mediated software mute establishes clear rules about when the VCA should be reading from the microphone, making it clear to the OS when the microphone status indicator should be illuminated and making it clear to the user when the VCA is reading from the microphone.

### 6.3 VCA Privacy Policies
Few participants in our user study were aware of the data collection or sharing policies of popular VCAs. Around 70% of our participants believe that the mute button blocks the transmission of microphone data or disables the microphone altogether. VCA service providers should provide detailed definitions of data collection scenarios rather than generic statements about how they collect data about their users. All VCAs actively query the microphone when the user is muted, and they might have legitimate purposes. For example, Zoom alerts the user when they try to speak with their microphone muted. The privacy policies of these services need to be explicit about microphone access, which is not currently the case.

We analyzed the privacy policies of the VCAs from Table 2 to understand how do they describe their privacy practices. Other than Google [20], no privacy policy makes an explicit mention to the mute button and how microphone data is accessed when the user is muted. The mention of the mute button in Google Meet’s privacy policy refers to the meeting organizer’s ability to mute others. Also, the privacy policies are vague about the data collected when the user is running a VCA. Some privacy policies, such as Whereby’s and Google Meet’s, explicitly mention that they do not collect audio data. Other VCA privacy policies do not mention collecting audio data at all. Most policies describe their data collection, in general terms, as “depend[ing] on the context of your interactions” [33]. The common reasons that VCA service providers cite for collecting data are to improve “app performance” [13, 33], to facilitate “research” [33, 44], and for “user analytics” [13, 33, 44].

Interestingly, Cisco’s privacy policy [13] mentions audio data in the context of “types of personal information that [Cisco] may process.” Cisco’s privacy policy is not specific about when the collection is happening and about the purposes of this collection. However, a different privacy datasheet [31] from Cisco mentions:

> Cisco Webex Meetings **does not:**
Monitor or interfere with your meeting traffic or content.

Our findings suggest that, contrary to the statement in the privacy policy, Webex monitors, collects, processes, and shares with its servers audio-derived data, while the user is muted. To inform Cisco of our investigation results, we opened a responsible disclosure with Cisco about our findings. As of February 2022, their Webex engineering team and Privacy team are actively working on solving this issue.
