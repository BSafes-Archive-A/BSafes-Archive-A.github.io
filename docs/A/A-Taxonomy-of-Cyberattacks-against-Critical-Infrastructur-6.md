## TAXONOMY DEVELOPMENT
Prior studies have attempted to classify knowledge on cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. Alcaraz and Zeadally (2015) provided a detailed list of security controls derived from a number of US and international standards and best practices. However, the focus of the project was to highlight which controls are most referenced across the standards and derive an inventory of those top controls to prevent cyberattacks against SCADA systems. Another study proposed by Papp et al. (2015) used the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database to identify five types of cyberattacks: (1) precondition, (2) vulnerability, (3) target, (4) attack method, and (5) effect of the attack. However, these classifications are general and not relevant directly to SCADA systems and critical infrastructure. And finally, (Humayoun, 2011) conceptualize cyber-physical systems (CPS) from a security perspective. They propose a three-dimensional taxonomy that explains cybercrimes based on CPS systems, CPS components, and a security dimension. While others have investigated this issue in the past, the proposed classifications have not been empirically tested due to the sensitive nature of the context.

The current study addresses these gaps and offers a comprehensive classification of cyberterrorism attacks with consideration of the hackers’ motivation. With regards to policy recommendations, our focus is on the guardianship aspect of RAT and how the government can better protect the legacy SCADA systems and improve the security posture of these facilities.

The first dimension, hacker motivation, is related to the offenders which could be politically, socio-culturally, and/or economically motivated. The second dimension represents the cyber, physical, and cyber-physical components of any cyber-physical system (CPS) and is a differentiation of the various aspects of the suitable target. The third dimension, security, is related to the threats, vulnerabilities, and controls that represent the lack of the capable guardian. These different dimensions are conceptualized and depicted in Figure 2.
