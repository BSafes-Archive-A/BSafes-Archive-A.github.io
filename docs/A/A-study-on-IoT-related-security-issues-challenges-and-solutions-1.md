## 1. Introduction
Web of Things (IoT) alludes to the following advancement of the web, concurring to the Web Society [14]. It'll empower a organizing framework that interfaces a expansive number of devices, allowing them to gather information and communicate with one another in arrange to create handled shrewd choices. We should point out that devices refer to any item that has been integrated with the suitable equipment and computer program to supply handling and organizing capabilities, which is an critical qualification. Whereas the Web of Things (IoT) offers associations with devices that they can utilize to oversee their resources and create more effective and cost-effective trade models, it moreover gives organisations with the capacity to put through with one another by means of a assortment of channels. This innovation moreover contributes to the advancement of a hyper-connected society, and it has the potential to improve transportation and mobility [2, 3]. A number of issues of security and privacy, however, must be solved before the technology can be more widely accepted and used in the real world on a widespread basis. Because of the Internet of Things, we need to have a thorough understanding of the difficulties presented by security and privacy concerns associated with it, as well as an understanding of the possible solutions to these problems. If we do not have a thorough understanding of the difficulties presented by security and privacy concerns associated with it, as well as an understanding of the possible solutions to these problems, we will both be jeopardised. By the end of this essay, we will have a better understanding of some of the security and privacy challenges that have developed in the wake of the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as some of the alternative solutions that have been presented to deal with these difficulties.

Web of Things (IoT) could be a tremendous organize made up of connected systems that incorporate gadgets with restricted asset capabilities. In its most essential shape, the IoT could be a colossal arrange made up of interconnected systems that contain gadgets with constrained asset capabilities.Because of the limited resources that IoT devices have available to them, they are unable to take use of the complete security suites that are available on traditional networks. In this position, one must either build a new security architecture for the Internet of Things or rely on current solutions, which creates a problem for the security community. However, it is critical to make efforts to guarantee that lightweight security solutions are utilised to defend the Internet of Things, in order to avoid the devices' resources being exhausted by security-related activities and their performance being compromised.

In terms of security and privacy, there is a challenge linked with the Internet of Things, and that problem is the difficulty in creating safe and secure communication pathways between devices. A large number of separate components are all running at the same time, which is due to the nature of the technology in which they are contained.

Maintaining proper and secure communication and interaction among the components at the network edge is difficult because of the network edge's proximity to the user's computer. Concerns about data privacy and confidentiality have also been highlighted in relation to the Internet of Things, which has sparked a great deal of debate. It is possible, for example, to use this technology to link a large number of networks together in a cost-effective manner. In contrast, a user may not have complete control over individual networks in the great majority of circumstances, exposing data to a broad variety of secrecy and confidentiality concerns. As an additional benefit to users, the Web of Things (IoT) includes a enormous number of connected gadgets and systems. Due to the expanding complexity of distinguishing, dissecting, and checking basic components in arrange to guarantee compliance with security prerequisites [12], it is getting to be more troublesome to do so. It is additionally troublesome to attain an worthy degree of secure data stream and believe over a shifted assortment of vertical data innovation foundations.
