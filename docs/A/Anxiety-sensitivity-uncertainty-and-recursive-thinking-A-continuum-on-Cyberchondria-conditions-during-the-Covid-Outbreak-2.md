## Methods
### *Research Strategy*
This systematic review has been carried out according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines [41]. Using 3 key terms related to the psychological aspects of cyberchondria (“Cyberchodria” OR “Anxiety” AND “Quarantine”), articles have been selected according to their title and abstract; the entire article was read if the title/abstract was related to the specific issue of the relation between health anxiety and cyberchondria in the quarantine period, to see whether the article potentially met the inclusion criteria or not. References of the selected articles were also examined to identify additional studies meeting the inclusion criteria.

Table 1. A list of the searched terms entered into the PubMed search engines for identification of the studies for this systematic review.

### *The selection criteria for the study*
To select only the relevant criteria for the study, both the titles and the abstracts of all quotations identified in the literature search have been examined (Table 2), and thus, 396 publications have been identified, and therefore the total number of relevant publications was reduced to 15. The articles were included in the review according to the following inclusion criteria: English language, publication in peer-reviewed journals, quantitative information on the relationship between health anxiety and cyberchondria in the quarantine period for epidemics and pandemics. Some articles were excluded by title, abstract, or full text for irrelevance to the topic under discussion. Further exclusion criteria were review articles, editorial comments, and case reports/series.

Figure 1 shows the process diagram followed to select the included studies. All the articles were selected based on the presence/absence of the search criteria.
