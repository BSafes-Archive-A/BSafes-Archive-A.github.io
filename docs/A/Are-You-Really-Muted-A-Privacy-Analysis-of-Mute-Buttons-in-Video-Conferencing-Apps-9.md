### A Model Architecture

![Fig. 10. The classification architecture for the background activi- ties.](https://statics.bsafes.com/images/papers/Are-You-Really-Muted-A-Privacy-Analysis-of-Mute-Buttons-in-Video-Conferencing-Apps-fig-10.png)

**Fig. 10.** The classification architecture for the background activi- ties.

During training, we observe that batch size affects training speed and performance. Our classifier is trained with batch size of 500, epoch of 400, window length of 7 and learning rate of 0.001 .

### B Chromium API
Chromium acted as a layer between the operating system and the browser based VCAs. To verify microphone access we injected our own logging scripts in the source code of Chromium. Knowing when an app accesses the microphone requires several functions to be monitored, the main functions we observed were:

1. PulseAudioInputStream::ReadData() ReadData indiscriminately reads audio frames from the operating system into a local buffer, regardless of the VCA’s mute status (muted or unmuted). 

2. opus_encode_native() After receiving a full microphone audio frame from the operating system, PulseAudioInputStream::ReadData() passes that frame to opus_encode_native(), regardless of the VCA’s mute status. 

3. AudioSendStream::AudioSendStream() – transfers the encoded audio stream to the web-based VCA. It is also a WebRTC API call that executing code can call. AudioSendStream only hands the encoded audio data to the VCA if WebRTC’s software mute function is disabled.

These three functions outline a general flow of audio data within Chromium in Linux(as of writing this). Logging important variable’s states within these three functions painted an accurate picture of microphone usage while the user was muted.

### D Music Mode Correlation Results

![Fig. 11. Correlation between audio gain reported by Webex and input audio signal power level (in dbA) when music mode is enabled. Although we cannot observe the raw audio while muted, the statistics reported by Webex leak information about the a user’s background noise.](https://statics.bsafes.com/images/papers/Are-You-Really-Muted-A-Privacy-Analysis-of-Mute-Buttons-in-Video-Conferencing-Apps-fig-11.png)

### E Codebooks
We present our consolidated codebooks to three openended questions (*Q1*, *Q2*, and *Q3* ) that are independently generated by two authors in Tables 4, 5, and 6.

![Table 4. Codebook for responses to Survey Question Q1](https://statics.bsafes.com/images/papers/Are-You-Really-Muted-A-Privacy-Analysis-of-Mute-Buttons-in-Video-Conferencing-Apps-table-4.png)

**Table 5.** Codebook for responses to Survey Question Q2


### F Windows API
We can trace the data using the following three methods, which are part of the Windows API DLLs:

1. BCryptEncrypt in the ncryptsslp.dll library for encrypting network traffic before sending. 

2. IAudioRenderClient::GetBuffer method in the Windows 10 32-bit Audio interface which fills a local buffer with raw audio data. 

3. IAudioRenderClient::ReleaseBuffer method in the Windows 10 32-bit Audio interface which releases the buffer space acquired in the getbuffer method call.

The BCryptEncrypt function is the method that some VCAs executes right before they send a packet over the network. After this method is executed, Wireshark captures the post-encrypted packet generated from the BCryptEncrypt function as it leaves the machine. Thus, being able to capture calls at the method before sending the packets grants us unencrypted network traffic. The GetBuffer method fills a local array in the app’s memory space with raw audio data. Using the argument’s address, we can follow each call and verify if the audio buffer that an app has is changing even while the user is muted. The ReleaseBuffer method tells us how many frames the app filled their own local buffer with, which gives us a good length of what the app is seeing. Examining the data we extracted from these methods we can build a dataset that, with confidence, observes audio data from the microphone to the network.

##### G Window Length 5 and 10
We present the confusion matrix of window length 5 and 10 in Fig. 14 and Fig. 13.
