## Appendix A
Recruitment Email

Dear Participant, 

My name is Michaela Ambrosius and I am a doctoral candidate in the Counseling program at Montclair State University in New Jersey. You are receiving this e-mail as an invitation to participate in a study about Jewish experiences with antisemitism. All Jewish individuals (18 years and older) residing in the U.S. are eligible to participate in this doctoral dissertation study.

The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the various forms of antisemitism (hostility towards Jews as a religious, ethnic, or racial group, and antiZionism) and Jewish identity.

Antisemitism continues to be a troubling issue worldwide and in the U.S. As a result, I am interested in researching antisemitism and anti-Zionism with the goal to support the Jewish community and to provide the counseling community with valuable information on how to assist Jewish individuals who have been exposed to this particular form of racism.

If you would like to participate in this study, you will complete a short online survey that will take you around 30 minutes to complete. Your survey responses will be anonymous and confidential. This study has received approval from the Institutional Review Board at Montclair State University. If you identify as a Jew and are interested in taking part in this research study, please click on the link below. If you know of any other Jewish individuals who may be interested in participating in this study please feel free to forward this e-mail to them.

“By clicking on this link, you are providing your consent to participate in this study.”

I appreciate your participation and thank you in advance for your time.
