## DISCUSSION
In the major attacks highlighted above, malware was the key technology component used for the attacks, which might be due to older versions of anti-malware software running or software being put on a periodic detection mode for the performance purpose. Investigations by the FBI revealed evidence that one or more of Bangladesh bank employees may have assisted in the theft although that possibility was initially played down by cyber investigators, who suggested the entire operation could have been carried out remotely. Further investigation showed the central bank of Bangladesh neither used a two-factor authentication on its systems nor changed its SWIFT default password till the hackers breached the bank's systems (Burne & Sidel, 2017).

The investigations implicated multiple channels and factors leading to the breaches. For instance, SWIFT used third-party vendors for part of the work, which probably increased the bank’s exposure to potential threats. On the other hand, all services were performed according to the instructions of local banks. It could not have deviated from the agreements without the bank’s consent. Security breaches of protocols such as the use of personal emails on dedicated computers attached to SWIFT’s servers might have been a possible avenue to corrupt the banks' systems with malware. The biggest consensus on the Bangladesh case is that the bank provided poor firewall protection and used a second-hand network switch worth $10. All four accounts in Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) in the Philippines, to which the stolen funds from Bangladesh were transferred into, were opened in May 2015 and were never used before the Bangladesh money transfer. The driver’s licenses used as identity documents in opening those accounts were fraudulent (Chilkoti et al., 2016). The above evidence pointed to the fact that this attack was planned well in advance. These were huge red flags, indicating the affected banks never conducted due diligence in the account opening process nor verified received funds. Verification and validation procedures should have been implemented for such large transfers. In addition, certain pre-existing conditions for those accounts should have been stipulated as part of protocols and enforced in local banks.

Some of the software purchased by NIC Asia Bank from so-called reliable vendors were found to be pirated. The fact that the use of pirated software is rampant among financial institutions in Nepal prevents these institutions from installing new patches or upgrading software and building a robust IT infrastructure. In the case of the Vietnamese bank hack, its risk warning and oversight systems played a key role in stopping the scam because it has enforced a strong internal control process since 2014. These components were missing in the other cases highlighted above.

Unfortunately, the recovery of money stolen by cybercriminals is not a simple process. As shown by the Bangladesh experience, all of the money stolen from Bangladesh disappeared after reaching the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where they were spread into casinos. The hunt for the $81 million in the Philippines was complicated by the restricted scope of the Philippine’s anti-money-laundering laws that do not include gambling facilities. Although SWIFT has an authentication protocol that prevents transfers to individuals or businesses under sanctions, this protocol does not protect customers from unauthorized transfers or recalls when they happen.

Even though SWIFT took steps to pass information to its member banks regarding security measures, it did not go further to enforce the standards by conducting periodic audits or stipulating mandatory compliance. On the other hand, banks cannot rely solely on SWIFT to prevent these cyberattacks. The responsibility of preserving and defending their assets remain with the individual banks since these transactions take place in their environments and on their premise. A common theme emerging from various reports is the mode of occurrence of these attacks, which presented similar patterns across all cases. The attackers compromised the bank's environment, obtained credentials with authority to initiate transactions, approved and sent messages on network, and then hid evidences by removing traces of fraudulent messages.

The Bangladesh case provides shocking evidence of the vulnerability of the banking system and a clear case of combined human factors. The biggest lesson from the Bangladesh bank heist and others is the cost of noncompliance is way higher than not building a proper IT infrastructure, even if it is capital intensive. Noncompliance of these banks with SWIFT's extensive and repeated security guidance for its customers was one of the contributing factors to their falling victims of cyberattacks. This should also serve as a lesson to Nepali banks and a warning to other financial institutions that generally hesitate to invest in IT infrastructure, and building a sound team that can frustrate criminal attempts from collapsing their entire system.

In summary, a series of successfully repeated attacks suggest hackers may have found ways into the messaging system the SWIFT member banks rely on to move money around the world. It is only a matter of time before we hear of more attacks if nothing is done to fortify networks. The immediate discovery of cybersecurity incidents like an attack is challenging due to the constantly changing threat environment.
