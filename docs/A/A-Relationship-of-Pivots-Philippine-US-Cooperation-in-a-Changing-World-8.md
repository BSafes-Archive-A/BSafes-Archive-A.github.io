## Past U.S. Administrations’ Relationships with the Philippines and Trajectory Under Biden
Despite Duterte’s history of animosity towards Washington, the Obama administration largely held on to aims of keeping the Philippines as an ally. As it has continuously been emblematic of U.S. policy to support democracy abroad and not mar friendships of nations in a region as pivotal as Southeast Asia, the U.S. side has done little to further destabilize the relationship between the two countries. Prior to Duterte, Obama and former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III had cooperated extensively. The most prominent of this cooperation was the bifurcated effort in economic cooperation (mainly through the Partnership for Growth) and cooperation in national security (primarily through the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement). <sup>39</sup> While Duterte’s profane remarks against Obama led the U.S. President to cancel a planned meeting, the relationship between the two leaders was restored during the 2016 ASEAN summit after they had a chance to properly get acquainted with one another.<sup>40</sup>

Under the Trump administration, the allyship between Manila and Washington had changed profoundly. As both Trump and Duterte facilitated a base of right-wing populism, forwarding dogma against perceived threats such as immigration and the drug trade, there was some apparent congruence in policies. However, these styles of governance by way of promoting nationalistic rhetoric proved harmful to international cooperation, a trend exacerbated by a continuation of Duterte’s actions. Decreased economic engagement was tantamount to a perceived cessation of the VFA, to which Trump responded with approval and a compliment towards Duterte’s leadership. <sup>41</sup>

The Biden administration has marked a significant change in trajectory as seen by the diminishing of isolationist policies. The Interim National Security Strategic Guidance document, published in 2021, details the Biden administration’s views pertaining to foreign policy, placating prodemocratic and anti-isolationist positions. <sup>42</sup> Though the document does not explicitly name the Philippines, it does name members of ASEAN and prioritizes them for deepened cooperation. This document also details the importance of protecting democratic governance abroad and its proliferation. As fears of democratic backsliding persist within the Marcos Jr. regime, increased levels of congruence could bolster democracy in the Philippines. <sup>43</sup> It is under this framework that closer ties with the Philippines are not only compatible within the Biden administration’s goals, but complementary to them.

Finally, the state.gov website on November 16th of 2021 published an official press release was published detailing a Joint Vision for a 21st Century United States-Philippines Partnership. This press release detailed current desires for greater cooperation with the Philippines through aims such as shared prosperity, legitimizing a laws-based maritime order, and enhancing the extant security architecture in the region.<sup>44</sup> Given these documents, it is evident that the current U.S. administration under Biden seeks a stronger partnership with the Philippines.
