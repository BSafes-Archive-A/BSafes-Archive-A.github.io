## History of China-Philippine Relations
The United States has certainly had a closer relationship with the Philippines for the past century, but China's history with the nation extends much further into the past. As early as the Song Dynasty, the Chinese Empire and the Philippines retained significant levels of maritime trade.<sup>14</sup> Under Spanish rule, trade between the Philippines and China expanded greatly due to the opening of new trade routes. As economic interaction between China and the Philippines flourished, so did cultural interaction, thus intertwining the two in a manner that the United States could never partake in.

Under the contemporary world order of the Cold War, the Philippines had chosen the side of the United States, thus brewing hostility between it and Communist China prior to the Sino-Soviet split. After the split, relations between the two countries changed with a newfound fondness, signaled by increased trade.<sup>15</sup> This amicability still was not enough to divorce the Philippines from the American sphere of influence, however. Upon the end of the Cold War, the absence of the Soviet Union led to the proliferation of the notion that ideological blocs and international camps were no longer necessary in conducting global politics. Under this novel sentiment, China could bolster its ties with nations such as the Philippines and it would do little to disrupt the contemporary geopolitical order. Barring the past decade, the gradual bolstering of relations between China and the Philippines reached its apex in 2007 during the visit of Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, under what Philippine President Macapagal-Arroyo declared as the “golden age of partnership.” <sup>16</sup>
