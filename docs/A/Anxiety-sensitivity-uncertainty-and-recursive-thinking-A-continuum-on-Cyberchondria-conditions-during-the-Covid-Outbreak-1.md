## Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had devastating effects on the human life worldwide, almost 24 million people have been infected, and more than 800,000 died, while this pandemic period exacerbated the psychological problems of many people [1].

In accordance with the studies in the literature, internet currently plays a vital role in everyday life, it has become a popular source of accessing health related information, evidence shows that more than 50% of the internet users have been searching for medical information during the quarantine period [2]. The term cyberchondria refers to the tendency of the patient to constantly look up for information on the web in order to obtain reassurance for their state of health [3-8].

DSM-5 has replaced the previous label of hypochondriac disorder with illness anxiety disorder and somatic symptoms disorder. The term hypochondria refers to a persistent preoccupation with or without fears about the possibility of having or developing one or more serious progressive or life-threatening diseases. The preoccupation is associated with a hypervigilance to and catastrophic misinterpretation of the bodily signs or symptoms including normal sensations and it is accompanied by avoidance or repetitive behaviors. Illness anxiety disorder refers to the existence of an excessive preoccupation accompanied by significant somatic symptoms [9,10].

Cyberchondria is related to hypochondria, and different psychopathologies as compulsive obsessive disorder (COD), specifically concerning contamination and compulsion [11-13]. Cyberchondria is different from other pathologies like compulsive obsessive disorder, anxiety for one’s own state of health and the pathological abuse of the internet, although there are some relations between the different symptomatologies [14].

Cyberchondria is related to conceptualized empiricism, as consisting of four dimensions: compulsion, which reflects the extent to which health-related internet research interferes with daily activities; distress, or the tendency to do research resulting in anxiety; excessiveness, or the repetitive quality of an individual’s searching; and reassurance, or the extent to which research motivates one by asking for medical consultation [11].

Cyberchondria means a constant search for information online, in order to obtain health-related information. This research can be carried out individually or through forumsharing individuals who have similar pathologies [15].

During the quarantine period due to epidemics or pandemics, several studies reported an increase of hypochondria and especially cyberchondria, such as depression, stress, low mood, irritability, insomnia, posttraumatic stress, anger, and emotional exhaustion [16-18].

Recently, Jungmann and Witthöft (2020) have investigated the links between trait health anxiety, cyberchondria, and virus anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. They hypothesized the relationship between cyberchondria and the current virus anxiety, and the findings of this study suggested that trait health anxiety and cyberchondria serve as risk factors during the pandemic period [19].

Cyberchondria incidence refers to about 1 to 5% of the population that reports having had at least one episode in the course of their lives [14]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020), the global effect of this pandemic has been devastating, and the major problem generated by the Corona Virus is the infodemic, a term that indicates the abundance of information, not always accurate, most people having open access to information due to internet connectivity and mass media, this information being overloaded, some information being fake news, and thus increasing anxiety and stress [20,21].

The study by Cava and co. showed that many people had psychological symptoms after the quarantine period, such as cyberchondria, vigilant handwashing and avoidance of crowds and, for some people, the return to normality was delayed by many months [22].

In a comparison between quarantined and nonquarantined health-care workers, the former were significantly more likely to report stigmatization, and rejection by the people in their local neighborhoods [23].

Several health-care workers involved in the Ebola outbreak in Senegal reported that quarantine had led their families to consider their jobs to be too risky, creating intra-household tension [17,22,24-26].

The scientific literature highlights that the part of the population that is mostly affected by cyberchondria are the students in the healthcare system, and healthcare workers, who are convinced of being affected by the pathologies they are studying [27].

Apart from students and healthcare workers, another professional category that is at high risk are the individuals working in the technological field, in these patients the metacognitive component being seriously compromised [28-30]. 

The possibility to access health-related information leads to an increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms, with a consequent sense of uncertainty leading to a pathological abuse of the internet [15]. 

Therefore, after the SARS epidemic, people considered that confusion stemmed from the differences in style, approach, and content of the various public health messages because of the poor coordination between the multiple jurisdictions and the levels of governmental involvement [31,32].

A recent meta-analysis carried out on a sample of 7,373 subjects has highlighted a significant relation between cyberchondria and anxiety for one’s own state of health [12].

According to Fergus and Spada (2018), the information found by the patients on the internet can lead to some benefits if used moderately and if it is shared and discussed with their own doctors, searching on the net outlining illusory diagnosis and also spreading inadequate information [28]. 

Diagnostic information on the internet can lead to catastrophic diagnoses of symptoms of moderate severity (such as, headache) attributing them to more severe symptoms [8,33]. Cyberchondria is more related to internet abuse than to health anxiety [14]. In other studies, anxiety has been reported as a dimension related to the internet abuse, because the first determines an increase in searching for health-related information via the internet [34]. Cyberchondria can undermine the doctor-patient relationship, as patients have difficulty in accepting the health-related information reported by the doctor, because it is in contrast with what was reported on the internet [35].

Lack of trust in the doctor leads to an increase in sanitary costs because patients ask for several consultations to several health professionals [36].

Lastly, the impairment of the doctor-patient relationship undermines compliance. Patients can develop dysfunctional behavior like missing appointments and/or taking drugs without any medical prescription, and consequently these patients’ quality of life results undermined [4,37].

Another psychological aspect related to cyberchondria is uncertainty, which is a predictor of health anxiety. Uncertainty occurs when health-related information results ambiguous and paradoxical [11]. The sense of uncertainty is a fundamental element. The study by Farooq (2020) investigated the negative impact of the information overload in the Covid-19 pandemic, and showed that the information overload does not allow to form an accurate understanding of the situation, and increases the sense of uncertainty, consequently exacerbating health anxiety; moreover, the information overload makes it difficult to perceive the situation objectively [20].

Even the construct of self-esteem is related to cyberchondria, as a low self-esteem leads to obsessions and compulsions, consequently increasing hypochondriac behavior [38]. Another dimension related to cyberchondria is catastrophizing. Studies carried out on patients affected by chronic pain have revealed the importance of this element in the etiology of a disorder [33,39].

According to the World Health Organization Europe (2020), currently people are facing signs of fatigue and stress, deriving from the Covid-19 pandemic, this condition being called pandemic fatigue. This is a growing demotivation of people to implement the protective behaviors recommended for the health protection of both individuals and communities. The fear is cancelled when the population gets used to the threat and the same habits are repeated over time [40].

On the basis of the present literature, the aim of this review is to identify the psychological continuum connected to cyberchondria in the quarantine period for both epidemics and pandemics.
