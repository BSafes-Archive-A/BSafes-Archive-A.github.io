## Internal Politics of the Philippines Regarding Development
The Build Build Build (BBB) program from the Duterte administration seeks to accelerate the already extant growth found in the nation's recent history. This project goes hand in hand with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), and though it is not without its flaws, these internal efforts have enjoyed great success. The Philippines’ modern economy's faculties that provide strong bases for foreign direct investment (FDI) are reflected in its gross domestic product growth from 2012 to 2019, consistently achieving figures between 6 percent and 7 percent. <sup>30</sup> “The Philippines has moved in recent years to liberalize several sectors of the economy to simulate foreign direct investment,” thus opening the door for investment from other countries, most notably the United States, China, and Japan. <sup>31</sup>

As internal politics may play a role of gatekeeping or possibly guiding prospective investment, it may be prudent to promote potential projects that do more to uplift the general populous. As shown in a working paper dissecting the machinations of the BBB initiative from the Philippine Institute of Development Studies, there is a distinct lack of “PDP targets in the area of social infrastructure (e.g., [sic] school buildings and health facilities),” highlighting a potential area to focus U.S. efforts. <sup>32</sup> Additional suggested types of investment include those concerning environmental sustainability with goals of reducing pollution and mitigating climate change. The official website for the BBB program boasts lofty promises, among which are reducing poverty by 25 percent by 2022 and making infrastructure a top priority of the government. <sup>33</sup> Though these ideals may be little more than campaign promises from Duterte, clear positive sentiments towards development from the nation's leadership bodes well for the future of interconnectivity and globalization for the Philippines.

In June of 2022, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. succeeded Rodrigo Duterte as President. <sup>34</sup> The Marcos Jr. platform largely boasts a continuation of Duterte’s policies (as made evident by his comments on Duterte’s style of governance as well as his Vice-Presidential candidate being Duterte’s daughter).<sup>35</sup> While these reasons point to a continuation of pro-China rhetoric, the Marcos Jr. platform is much more flexible than Duterte’s and popular support for cooperation between Washington and Manila may reflect in future policies, furthering prospects for U.S. engagement. Though Duterte’s exit from the presidency may prelude fundamental changes in Manila’s patterns of governance, Marcos Jr.’s status as the son of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. casts dubious prospects on potential amelioration of democracy and consequently further disincentivizes U.S. distancing.
