## Results
Figure 1 summarizes the flowchart of the articles selected for the review. The research on the PubMed database provided for a total of 396 quotations; no additional meeting inclusion criteria were identified by checking the reference list of the selected papers. After the screening, a total of 15 studies assessing the psychological aspects of cyberchondria met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review (Table 2). The selected studies demonstrated the relationship between health anxiety and cyberchondria, in particular the examined literature suggests how constantly searching for online health-related information increases the anxiety levels during the pandemic and the epidemic period. In particular, Bai and colleagues (2004) investigated stress reactions among the staff members in the hospital, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and the results highlighted the value of shortened work hours as a means by which the tremendous stress caused by a SARS outbreak can be reduced and the value of unambiguous information can reduce uncertainty [23]. Casagrande et al. (2020) investigated the effects of the quarantine period for Covid-19 among the Italian population [42]. The results of this study revealed that the participants reported poor sleep, high anxiety, and high distress. Cava et al. (2005) explored the experience of home quarantine during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and showed that people felt uncertainty and anxiety after the quarantine period [22]. Desclaux et al. (2017) studied contact cases’ perceptions and acceptance of contact monitoring at the field level, during the Ebola virus [24]. The quarantine period for the Ebola epidemic was associated with mood disorders. DiGiovanni et al. (2004) explored the factors influencing compliance with quarantine in Toronto during the 2003 SARS outbreak; the findings of this study showed that there was increased stress in people after the quarantine period [31]. Farooq (2020) investigated the impact of the online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic, and the results of this research showed the relationship between online information and self-isolation during the pandemic period (COVID-19) [20]. Hashemi et al. (2020) proposed a model in order to understand the associations between problematic internet use (PIU), cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, metacognition beliefs, and fear of COVID-19 [2]. Jalloh et al. (2018) studied the impact of Ebola experiences and the risk perceptions on mental health, during this period people feeling anxiety and depression [43]. Jokic-Begic et al. (2020) examined the way in which cyberchondria is related to changes in the levels of COVID-19 in Croatia, and showed that cyberchondria played an important role in the pandemic period, and increased the mental health problems, such as anxiety [16]. Jungmann & Witthöft (2020) investigated the links between trait health anxiety, cyberchondria, and virus anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, and demonstrated that Cyberchondria showed positive correlations with current virus anxiety [19]. Lee et al. (2005) studied stigma among residents of Amoy Gardens (AG), the first officially recognized site of community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong [17]. The findings showed that stigma affected most residents and took various form of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected by the people. Lei et al. (2020) assessed and compared the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by the quarantine during Covid-19 [44]. This study demonstrated there was a prevalence of anxiety and depression in people during the pandemic period. Liu et al. (2020) identified factors associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic, people reporting high levels of depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms, and high levels of loneliness [45]. Maftei & Holman (2020) investigated the effect of two opposing traits, optimism and neuroticism, on cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that neuroticism, age, and being female are positively associated with cyberchondria [1]. Mihashi et al., (2009) investigated strategies for broad mass isolation during the outbreak of infectious diseases, and suggested important strategies for the management of the psychological aspects of infectious diseases [18]. Wester et al. (2019) studied stigma during the exposure of healthcare workers to the Ebola virus; the results reported that the infectious disease increased anxiety among people [26].
