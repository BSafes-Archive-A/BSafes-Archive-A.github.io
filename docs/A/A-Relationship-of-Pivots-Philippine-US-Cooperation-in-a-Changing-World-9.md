## Advantages and Mechanisms of Greater Economic Engagement
The increased economic engagement from the United States towards the Philippines may precipitate through increasing the ease of access for investments (as well as incentives for these investments) and increasing investment directly from U.S. government institutions. While there are many applicable institutions towards this end, the two most pertinent are the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. Though current investment efforts are in place, particularly concerning the previously mentioned $60 billion through the B3W initiative, this amount encompasses the entire IndoPacific region. <sup>45</sup> Given the potential for an imbalance of investment in the region, it would be prudent to set investment goals for the Philippines in particular. This increased cooperation would enhance the ties between Washington and Manila as well as bolster the Philippines’ economic infrastructure. Added economic infrastructure would lead to increased gross domestic product and lead to lower prices for goods as volume would increase along with capacity for manufacturing, creating better outcomes for American consumers as well. <sup>46</sup>

Furthermore, advancements in manufacturing infrastructure in the Philippines detracts leverage from China as a manufacturing hegemon and makes the United States less reliant on them. Through policies such as Made in China 2025, there is a clear focus within Beijing’s governance to diminish its dependence on other countries, highlighting a phenomenon where China becomes less reliant on the world, but the world remains reliant on China.<sup>47</sup> This phenomenon spells out a mismatch of leverage between the United States and China regarding trade negotiations, but greater economic involvement in other countries—namely the Philippines—could counter rising influence from Beijing. As the relationship that the United States has with the Philippines is far friendlier than with China, the Philippines’ prospective role as a regional manufacturing hub bodes well for trade between the two countries. Additionally, economic investment does not need to only encompass manufacturing as there is great potential for a comprehensive approach, incorporating other fields such as the service sector and tech. <sup>48</sup> In summation, increased economic cooperation between the United States and the Philippines give both nations increased leverage in the global economy, improves the domestic market for both, and sets the groundwork for an enhanced mutually beneficial friendship.
