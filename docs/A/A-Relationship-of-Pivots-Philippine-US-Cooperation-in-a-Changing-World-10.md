## Advantages of Greater Military Cooperation in a Geopolitical Context
As China gains more influence in Southeast Asia through the BRI, the influence of the United States is ostensibly waning. Increased military cooperation between the United States and the Philippines would directly undermine this perception. In Southeast Asia, a region rife with democratic backsliding, the image of United States influence waning would only exacerbate this trend. Another benefit of greater military cooperation is advancement in both countries’ wars on terrorism, as counterterrorism efforts have often been a catalyst for past engagement. <sup>49</sup> Terrorism in the region of Southeast Asia primarily takes two forms: Pirates and Islamic extremists. Piracy has established itself as a salient issue in the vicinity, with prominence in the Sulu Sea, the body of water that surrounds the southern half of the Philippines. <sup>50</sup> Piracy in Southeast Asia has declined in recent years, but the extant state of it harms prospects of the safety of human lives as well as shipping lanes in the region. <sup>51</sup> Greater involvement from the United States can accelerate this decline, mitigating risk and enhancing cooperation.

Furthermore, the Islamic State’s presence in the Philippine province of Mindanao and history of terrorist attacks highlight a pressing issue in the region as well as a clear intersection with the U.S.’ war on terror.<sup>52</sup> Finally, the most effective manner to enforce legal norms is through precedence, and increased military presence would enhance the legitimacy of territorial boundaries as established in international law. Where this concept is pertinent is the case of the South China Sea as the current U.S. administration has explicitly recognized the 2016 UNCLOS ruling against China’s claims in the region (as made evident in the November 2021 document). <sup>53</sup> Even if the Duterte regime did not express much interest in the ruling (and if this perspective continues under Marcos Jr.), the contentious nature of this subject paired with the Philippines’ democratic foundations prelude a potential future administration where it will. Increased involvement would not only assist in the legitimacy of this ruling but for the foundations of the global rules-based maritime order that the seas are contingent on, providing a basis of regional security.

### *Consequences of Potential Distancing and Drawbacks of Cooperation*

There is a fundamental question as to whether an enhanced partnership between Washington and Manila is worth the potential downsides. Though the advantages are vast, the disadvantages exist to an extent and deserve acknowledgement to achieve a holistic view on the subject. The most conspicuous disadvantage is the potential for economic loss. The nature of investment pursues returns (in addition to recuperation) but investing in developing economies always carry extra risk. If investment is to be processed as Official Development Assistance, then the potential for return is lessened, but the terms of these loans create a more advantageous situation for the Philippines and its economy. <sup>54</sup> Despite this notion, investing in developing economies (even when prioritizing facets such as capacity building and sustainability) have been consistently shown to be “safe investment vehicles.” <sup>55</sup>

Moreover, the Philippines’ role as a burgeoning economy while reliance on China decreases bodes well concerning prospective advancement. Pitfalls are inevitable in this respect, but the potential for mutual economic gain, advancements in positions of leverage, and the decreased threat of piracy make cooperation a net positive. Another possible criticism of contemporary efforts regarding cooperation is perceived adulation of Duterte/ Marcos Jr. and an erosion of democratic principles. However, an abandonment of the Philippines as a country due to this erosion would only more so push the nation towards China, a regional hegemon with little respect for democracy. Duterte’s attitude towards China is not permanent, and neither are current lapses in democratic governance. As Marcos Jr. succeeds Duterte, new policies and alterations towards the Philippines’ government are on the horizon. Given these developments, a closer relationship with the United States as a proponent of democracy creates the best hope for the proliferation of such ideals.
