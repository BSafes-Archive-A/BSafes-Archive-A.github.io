## Conclusions
According to the cognitive behavioral model of health anxiety, the general dysfunctional beliefs about health, erroneous appraisals of nonthreatening symptoms as a serious health threat, and intolerance to any uncertainty related to health may evoke health anxiety as well as attempts to reduce it through safety seeking i.e., searching for reassurance of good health [62-65]. A successful treatment depends very much on sharing health-related information between the patient and the doctor and viceversa [66]. In fact, as pointed out in the previous literature, poor medical knowledge leads to the risk of misunderstanding of what patients read on the internet, with the consequent and increasing self-medicalization of patients [67,68].

In conclusion, different patterns of behavior of users searching for health information online have been explored in this review and the different dimensions of the construct of cyberchondria have been examined. It would be useful that clinicians and researchers pay attention to the significant relations between health-anxiety and pathological abuse of the internet, especially in restricted periods of isolation and vulnerability for people.
