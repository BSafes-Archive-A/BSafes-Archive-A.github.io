## PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
When it comes to cybercrimes, a significant issue is the lack of policies to effectively deter the offenders. This is partially due to the fact that cybercrimes often cross state and national borders and this creates a significant challenge when it comes to identifying and prosecuting the hackers. Furthermore, some countries such as China, Russia, or Ukraine for instance, do not have extradition treaties with the US, which makes it very difficult to prosecute any hackers residing in those countries.

Identifying the hackers who commit cybercrimes is equally challenging. The growing use of technology and the easier access to exploits on the Darknet make it easier even for someone with limited technical skills to commit crimes. And while technology is rapidly developing, our legislature on cybercrimes and cyberterrorism is lagging behind. Part of this is due to the complexity of the topic and the lack of understanding among policy makers. In addition, many still do not believe that entire critical infrastructures can be compromised with little effort. However, just because it has not happened in large scale, it does not mean that such attacks are impossible or unfeasible. The lack of adequate incident response guidelines is another important aspect of this problem.

The challenges of cybercrime and cyberterrorism also come from the fact that we are yet to see a massive attack in the US. However, critical infrastructure in Iran and Ukraine has already been attacked. In 2011, Iran’s nuclear program was compromised with the Stuxnet virus and in 2015 Ukraine’s power grid experienced a cyberattack. These examples demonstrate the global impact such crimes can have. This is often due to the fact that critical infrastructure has been developed a while ago when technology was not so sophisticated. So, when such legacy information systems, also known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), are now connected to the Internet, this creates a myriad of threats. For instance, the legacy systems are no longer maintained and often lack sufficient antivirus protection. These flaws make them easy targets of hackers who are often statefunded and have the resources, time, and opportunities to take down critical systems of national security.

The lack of a unified approach to protect critical infrastructure is another significant problem. There are so many different types of attacks and global organizations and governments fail to even agree on the definitions of “cybercrime” and “cyberterrorism”. Most criminological theories predominantly focus on physical crime and not much attention has been paid to explaining and reducing cybercrimes, especially those focused at attacking critical infrastructure and SCADA systems.
