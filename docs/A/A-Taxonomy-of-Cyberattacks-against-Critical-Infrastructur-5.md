## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
There is a pressing need to address the problem of cybercrime and cyberterrorism. The first step is to focus on the root cause of the problem by developing a taxonomy that can classify existing knowledge on the various types of attacks against critical infrastructure and the motivation of the hackers who launch them. Furthermore, utilizing Routine Activity Theory would be instrumental in taking a rigorous scholarly approach to the topic. This is a novel way of approaching the problem and can assist in the development of more adequate and relevant policies to prevent such attacks in the future. The current study aims to address the following research questions:

*RQ1: Can we classify knowledge on cyberattacks against critical infrastructure?*

*RQ2: Can we utilize Routine Activity Theory to mitigate cyberattacks against
critical infrastructure?*

The current study is the first attempt not only to create but empirically validate a taxonomy of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. Thus, we are taking a qualitative study approach and relying on grounded theory to identify themes and to evaluate the proposed classification of knowledge in the field. The goal is to assist practitioners and scholars in improving the guardianship of such facilities of national security and improve the existing incident detection and response practices. This is a crucial step to strengthen the overall security posture of our country.
