## 3. PROPOSED KNOWLEDGE RISKS TAXONOMY
Based on the existing literature, it appears that there is currently no agreement among researchers regarding the dimensions of knowledge risks. Lambe (2013) and Durst and Zieba (2018) classifications of knowledge risks are the most widely used. However, Durst and Zieba (2018) developed a more comprehensive and clear classification that divided knowledge risks into three categories: operational, technological, and human knowledge risks. This study will extend Durst and Zieba’s taxonomy based on existing research and business risks and enterprise risk management literature.

Sadgrove (2016) distinguished six kinds of business risks, namely: human, operational, strategic, technological, financial, and compliance risks. Compliance risks include stock exchange, tax, environmental laws, accounting standards, etc. Accordingly, this type is inapplicable to knowledge. The same holds true for financial risks. As a result, the authors of this study propose a new knowledge risk taxonomy divided into four categories: strategic, operational, human, and technological. This taxonomy will supplement Durst and Zieba's (2018) classification, which includes three groups: risks associated with human, technological, and operational knowledge.

According to Burkholder, Golas, and Shapiro (2007), employee risks are divided into two categories: strategic risk and operational risk. Management input varies between operational and strategic risks (Sadgrove, 2016). While strategic risks necessitate the attention of top management, operational risks may be resolved at a lower level of management. According to Burkholder et al. (2007), strategic risks include all risks to an organization's growth. Strategic risks are more difficult to detect, evaluate, and deal with because they have a long-standing effect, a large number of interconnecting variables, and are more abstract. (Bayer & Maier, 2007). Operational risks arise from an organization's day-to-day operations (Durst & Zieba, 2018; Sadgrove, 2016; Burkholder et al., 2007).

Moreover Perrot (2007) identified differences between operational and strategic knowledge. While strategic knowledge is essential for an organization to make major decisions, operational knowledge focuses on the day-to-day operations of the company. Since the literature on risk and knowledge management contains a strategic category, and extant research indicates that knowledge risk management is a combination of knowledge management and risk management, strategic knowledge risk could be added to the knowledge risks taxonomy.

Knowledge risks with long-term impact that require senior management/executive involvement are classified as strategic knowledge risks (Bayer & Maier, 2007). For both technology and human knowledge risks, this study will use Durst and Zieba's (2018) description. Individual variables including psychological, cultural, social, and personal characteristics, in addition to human resource management, are all considered in human KR. Technological KR are related to the utilization of different kinds of technologies by firms (Durst & Zieba, 2018).

Brătianu (2018) noted that when an organizational culture encourages sharing of knowledge, knowledge hiding might be considered a risk. Furthermore, he stated that knowledge waste cannot be regarded as a knowledge risk. It is, rather, the outcome of an ineffective knowledge management. The authors of this research agree with Brătianu (2018) on knowledge waste, but because knowledge sharing is so important in organizations, knowledge hiding will be treated as a risk in this study.

Gaghman (2019) argued that knowledge loss is a strategic risk that affect firm’s overall strategy. The loss of knowledge resourcesis irreversible, resulting in a void that has a negative impact on business activities execution (Bayer & Maier, 2007). Olander and Hurmelinna-Laukkanen (2015) stated that as a result of knowledge leaking and leaving, knowledge can be lost. According to Dalkir (2005), strategic capabilities are aggregated to organizational competencies and are things that an individual is skilled at. He went on to say that the more valuable a capability is, the less likely it is to be shared among many individuals, making the company more vulnerable if those employees quit.

Although Durst and Zieba (2018) considered knowledge loss and leakage to be consequences of knowledge risk, Durst et al. (2019) treated both as knowledge risks when analysing the link between KRM and organizational performance. Furthermore, Brătianu et al. (2020) stated that knowledge risk is generated by knowledge loss and leakage, and their study focused solely on knowledge loss among other hazards. On the other hand, leaking confidential knowledge to rivals has negative impact on an organization’s performance and competitive advantage (Vafaei Zadeh, Hanifah, Foroughi & Salamzadeh, 2019).

It's worth noting that most knowledge loss research looks to NASA as a classical example of knowledge loss. Knowledge loss had a long-term influence on NASA's operations and performance (Jennex, 2014), demonstrating that knowledge loss is a strategic risk. As a result, knowledge loss and leakage may be regarded as strategic knowledge risks.

The discrepancy between what a company needs to know and what it actually knows is referred to as the knowledge gap, and it is a strategic gap (Zack, 1999). The larger the knowledge gap, the more likely it is that timely strategies and capabilities will not be available for implementation (Perrot, 2007). Thus, this study consider knowledge gaps as strategic knowledge risk in congruence with Zack (1999).

Following the logic of the above arguments, the proposed knowledge risk taxonomy and its components are as follows: (1) *human knowledge risks:* insufficient or missing competencies, forgetting, unlearning, knowledge hoarding, knowledge hiding; (2) *technological knowledge risks:* risk associated with social media, risk associated with old technologies, risks associated with cybercrime, digitalization risks; (3) *strategic knowledge risks:* knowledge loss, knowledge leakage, and knowledge gap risks; and (4) *operational knowledge risks*: risk of improper knowledge application, risk of using obsolete/unreliable knowledge, knowledge continuity risks, knowledge articulation risk, relational risks, knowledge outsourcing risks, espionage, communication risks, merger and acquisition risks, knowledge transfer risk.
