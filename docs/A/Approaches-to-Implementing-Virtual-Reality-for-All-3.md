## Cognitive/Emotional/Learning Disabilities
For students who may have cognitive, emotional and/or learning disabilities, VR can often act as a safe space that helps students not only enjoy what they’re doing but learn how to handle different experiences in a non-threatening environment (Yahkubova, 2021). In these spaces students can practice social interactions and VR has also been found to help increase student engagement when using this immersive technology. However, when implementing various types of activities, consider possible emotional triggers (something that can elicit an intense emotional reaction) when selecting VR content. Keep activities light and simple.

## Physical
VR may require body movements that are difficult for individuals with physical disabilities. Physical disabilities can include a wide range of movement issues including problems with head movements such as side to side movements, difficulty with hand or arm movements, or difficulty or inability to walk (maybe requiring the use of a wheelchair). There are studies currently happening to address many types of physical disabilities and the use of VR (Mott, 2020). It is therefore important that the types of VR used require simple movements. Check with the student or appropriate school personnel (e.g., physical therapists) if you have questions about a student’s abilities to participate in a particular use of VR technology or if you are not sure whether a student will be able to access a program using the VR technology that is available, locate similar VR content that is easy to access and available via a web browser.
