## Abstract
The Internet of Things is now being developed to be the most cutting-edge and user-centric technology in the works. Raising both an individual's and society's level of life is the goal of this endeavor. When a technology advances, it always acquires certain flaws, which are always open to being attacked and taken advantage of in some manner. In this work, the problems posed by the Internet of Things (IoT) based on the fundamental security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability are discussed. It has also been discussed how an overview of the security restrictions, requirements, processes, and solutions implemented for the challenges generated in secured communication inside the IoT ecosystem. In this paper, the vulnerabilities of the underlying Internet of Things network are brought to light, and many security concerns on multiple tiers of the Internet of Things ecosystem have been examined. Based on the findings of our research into the vulnerabilities that are now present, a variety of potential solutions have been proposed in order to solve the ongoing problems that are plaguing the IoT ecosystem. In addition to that, it provides an overview of the various protocols that are used for security in IoT. 

Keyword: Internet of Things,security, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, availability.
