## 7 Conclusion
This survey is conducted to provide an overview and analysis of existing access control-based authorization frameworks for smart homes and note the essential requirements and challenges in need of consideration while designing and implementing access control for smart homes. It also provides an idea concerning the ideal access control-based authorization framework for smart homes, which will cover all the existing requirements and challenges of authorization frameworks for smart homes. In the future, more focus will be on building more dynamic and flexible authorization frameworks for smart homes that can handle multiple users and different types of devices and tolerate emergency access rights cases. Moreover, the frameworks will be able to handle machine-to-machine (robots to other smart devices) access rights without any human interpretation.
