## 1. INTRODUCTION
The currency of the modern economy is knowledge. Unlike other resources, the value of knowledge increases when it is applied (Durst & Zieba, 2018; Smits & de Moor, 2004). However, knowledge is not always positive and can be harmful. Organizations will face a variety of risks as a result of a lack of knowledge, its disappearance, its inappropriate utilization, or the consequences of a variety of situations of knowledge usage (Brătianu, Neștian, Tiță, Vodă, & Guță, 2020; Durst & Zieba, 2020; Durst, Bruns, & Henschel, 2016).

Knowledge risk denotes the risk of causing disturbances in the organizational knowledge field (Brătianu & Bejinaru, 2020). It is comprised of a broad set of knowledge-related threats that a firm might encounter (Durst, Zieba, & Aisenberg Ferenhof, 2018). The risk arises as result of knowledge spillover, leakage, loss, absence, misapplication, or any other event that creates uncertainty (Brătianu et al., 2020; Colemann & Casselman, 2016).

Knowledge risk is an emergent construct in knowledge management (KM) that is related to risk management (Brătianu et al., 2020). According to Neef (2005), knowledge risk management is an integration of two other fields, risk and knowledge management. Bayer and Maier (2007) are among the first researchers to shed light on the negative impact of knowledge risk on knowledge assets. Firms should not continue to ignore knowledge risks, but should instead look for ways to manage those risks (Durst et al., 2016). Thus, organizations’ ability to identify, lessen and manage knowledge risks is critical for achieving long-term benefits (Brătianu et al., 2020; Durst & Zieba, 2020; Jurczak, 2017).

Organizations of all sizes and types face a variety of knowledge-related risks (Durst, Hinteregger, & Zieba, 2019). The risk is caused by knowledge leakage, loss, gaps, concealment, hoarding, or any other event that creates uncertainty (Brătianu et al., 2020). According to Handa, Pagani, and Bedford (2019), the failure rate for knowledge management procedures ranges between 50% and 70%, necessitating the assessment of knowledge risks. Furthermore, the digital transformation altered the way knowledge is transmitted, but it also introduced new knowledge risks (Zeiringer & Thalmann, 2020). Knowledge risks can have a variety of negative consequences, such as operations disruptions, a loss of competitive advantage, or poor performance (Durst et al., 2019). Firms must review their knowledge management approaches to account for potential knowledge risks, according to Durst and Zieba (2018).

The field of knowledge management has received significant attention, and knowledge management has been investigated in a variety of contexts. However, studying knowledge from a risk standpoint is uncommon (Zeiringer & Thalmann, 2020). Knowledge risk is a new topic of study in the field of knowledge management (Durst, 2019), and there has been little research in this area (Brătianu et al., 2020). Knowledge risk is still in its infancy, and the existing literature is primarily composed of conceptual and theoretical papers (e.g., Temel & Durst, 2021; Durst & Zieba, 2019). As a result, there is unquestionably a need for a thorough understanding of how organizations recognize and manage the potential risks of knowledge (Durst, Zieba, & Aisenberg Ferenhof, 2018).

On the other hand, existing research presents a fragmented understanding of the concept of knowledge risk (Durst et al., 2019). Knowledge concealment, knowledge leakage, and knowledge loss are examples of these. Furthermore, there is no agreement on the knowledge risk dimensions or classification of the term. Previous research (Durst & Zieba, 2018; Lambe, 2013) has provided a variety of interpretations of knowledge risk-related concepts. Furthermore, Durst and Zieba (2017) emphasized that existing research is insufficient to describe all potential knowledge risks and that a clear distinction between them is required.

Based on the foregoing, the purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic overview of knowledge risk conception and fill a gap in the existent literature. This task is completed by summarizing and analysing major theoretical conceptions about knowledge risks, and then proposing a new taxonomy of knowledge risks based on existing research, as well as business risks and enterprise risk management literature. This paper offers a more holistic view of knowledge risks and will encourage and guide future research in this field. Also, it will assist firms in identifying their critical knowledge, especially the one that is at risk and develop a knowledge management strategy to address those risks.

The following is how the paper is structured. *First*, definitions of knowledge risk and knowledge risk management are presented, followed by discussion of the various perspectives of knowledge risks that have been presented in the literature. *Then*, a theoretical framework was developed to categorize knowledge risks. The final section summarizes important findings and their implications for further research.
