## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The research was conducted using a case study methodology. The author examined a series of SWIFT breaches, focusing on why the member banks fell for social engineering and insider threat attacks, the implications of those breaches, and how it could potentially be resolved. Case study method has been widely applied in social science and behavioral studies, which is utilized when an in-depth investigation is required. The rationale of utilizing case study method lies in that such approach is particularly suitable to explore ‘how’ or ‘why’ questions about a contemporary set of events (Yin 2014). Therefore, the research questions and focus of this study would be well supported. The author followed the five major steps of case study research identified by Yin (2014):

- Identify the research phenomenon; 

- Design the study with research questions; 

- Collect data by gathering literature, secondary data, and relevant technical reports;

- Analyze the results for the research questions; and 

- Interpret findings.

To locate the relevant literature on the surge of SWIFT data breaches and contributing factors to those breaches, the author has used multiple literature search strategies, including online search of major databases and manual search of references. Specifically, the author focused on several major online databases including ProQuest, ABI/INFORM, ACM Digital Library, and Security Management Practices. The initial search was based on combination of a series of key words such as SWIFT, data breach, financial section, and security program.
