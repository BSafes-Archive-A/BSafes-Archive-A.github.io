## China-Philippine Relations in the Modern Era
In 2013, Beijing announced the One Belt One Road Initiative. As of today, the One Belt One Road Initiative has largely transformed into the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. Given its proximity, one of the BRI's largest regions of focus is Southeast Asia. Yearly investment from China to the Philippines has fluctuated during the past 5 years from below $10 billion to almost $90 billion, and the most recent figure is resting at $15 billion. <sup>24</sup> Trade figures between China and the Philippines have an upward trajectory however, with total bilateral trade reaching almost $50 billion with an annualized growth rate of roughly 17 percent over the past 5 years.<sup>25</sup> Such cooperation is not universal, however, as the initial period of the BRI was marred by a new development between China and the Philippines—a territorial dispute in the South China Sea. Affirmations from Beijing regarding China's historic maritime claims to the Spratley Islands upset officials in the Philippines as these claims encroached directly upon its sovereign territory. China did not budge on the issue, however, and the case was eventually settled in The Hague under a tribunal determined by the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). <sup>26</sup> After three years of heavy deliberation, the tribunal determined that China did not have rightful jurisdiction over these islands, but the ruling was vehemently rejected by Chinese officials who claimed it to be an “external provocation.” <sup>27</sup>

Despite the increasing tensions, in 2017 (one year after Duterte’s inauguration), the Philippines’ partnership in the BRI was “affirmed and welcomed” by Chinese officials. <sup>28</sup> Accompanied with this partnership came a slew of BRI projects that have not ceased in its reach, with more prominent ones being the aforementioned City of Pearl and New Clark City. As a result of new BRI projects, many fear a phenomenon in which Beijing pursues infrastructure projects with the goal of crippling the target country with debt and therefore gaining large sums of equity in its markets, a form of neo-colonialism known colloquially as debt-trap diplomacy. The existence of debt-trap diplomacy is a controversial matter, though what is not is the existence of fears surrounding the phenomenon, and it is evident that such fears may go on to shape further interactions between Philippine and Chinese officials.

As a democracy, public sentiment bears importance in the Philippines’ politics, and the unpopularity of China does little to support relations between the two countries (despite contemporary President Duterte's positive sentiments). Furthermore, an influx of migrant workers from mainland China has accompanied an influx of investment as well. There is no issue with this premise alone, but conflict arises due to the externality that “Chinese investors preferred to employ Chinese workers in order to overcome the language barrier.” <sup>29</sup> Unfortunately, such developments in the Philippine job market (combined with disputes in the South China Sea) have cultivated a level of Sinophobia that currently afflicts Filipinos of Chinese descent (commonly known as Tsinoys) and recent mainland immigrants alike.
