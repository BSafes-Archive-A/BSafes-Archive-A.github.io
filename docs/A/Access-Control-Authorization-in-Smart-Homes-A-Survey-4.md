## 4 Access Control in Smart Home
Access control is an essential technique for smart home systems, and it should adapt to the different requirements of smart homes. It is difficult and not optimal to only take the other systems’ access control schemes and implement them in the smart home system. There should be a suitable access control that matches the requirements of the smart home.

Although there are many privacy and security issues in smart homes, in this survey, we only focus on the authorization and how to protect and ensure that smart home devices, applications, and data are safe from unauthorized access. To address this issue, access control of the smart home system needs to be enforced. This tactic guarantees that only the authorized users can have access to smart home resources.

As explained in Section 2, a smart home is different from other domains. It has its specific characteristics and requirements that need to be observed while designing and implementing the related access control scheme. Figure 3 shows the key functional characteristics of the smart home. The requirements of these characteristics differ as follows:

**Scalability:** The smart home is a dynamic environment in which new devices and resources can be added anytime. Therefore, the smart home system should provide sufficient scalability for users.

**Heterogeneity:** Because several vendors produce smart home devices, smart home components should be easily communicated with each other.

**Reliability:** As the smart home is becoming a part of daily life and multiple users may want to access its resources, the smart home system should be easy to use and designed to provide users with sufficient reliability and availability.

**Lightweight:** Because the smart home devices are resource-constrained with low-power and memory specifications, the access control system should be lightweight. The smart home system is also sensitive to latency, and it should be automated. Furthermore, the smart home is more suitable with a centralized structure, multiple user management, and a centralized access control system.

To summarize, as shown in Fig. 3, the smart home characteristics include low (scalability, reliability, and latency), medium (dynamicity and automation), and high (heterogeneity, lightweight property, and user involvement)[26] .

In Table 2, we briefly discuss requirements that should be met while designing and developing an access control system for the smart home environment. It is strictly committed to Requirement1, Requirement2, Requirement3, and Requirement6, and partially committed to access control Requirement4 and Requirement5.
