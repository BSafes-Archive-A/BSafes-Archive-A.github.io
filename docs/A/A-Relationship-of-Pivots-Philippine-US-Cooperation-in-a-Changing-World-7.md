## Obstacles to Overcome
One reason Chinese investment through the BRI is creating such a grand impact is its larger scale when compared to U.S. investment. Currently, Chinese investment in the Philippines dwarfs American investment due to a combination of action from Beijing and a lack of action from Washington. In 2019, the Trump administration unveiled the Blue Dot Network, placing a figurative blue dot on greenlit projects that met sustainability goals and promoted good governance in recipient countries. The budget of this initiative for the entirety of Indo-Pacific is $60 billion, which is simply not enough when compared to other actors in the region (not only China, but countries like Japan as well). <sup>36</sup> The Blue Dot Network has since joined the Biden administration’s Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, largely remaining in its original functionality.

As the Philippines and the United States have enjoyed an alliance for much of the past century, complacency and insularity from the American side in the face of a more open Philippines is perhaps the largest obstacle to overcome. Vocal remarks, often directly from Duterte himself, were the most prominent indicator of cracks in the relationship between the United States and the Philippines, beginning shortly after his inauguration in June of 2016. Later that year, Duterte expressed interest to “break up with America,” along with several disparaging expletives directed at U.S. President Barack Obama.<sup>37</sup> These comments, accompanied with the initiation of the process for abrogation for the VFA between the two nations in 2020, painted a bleak picture of deteriorating relations. However, Duterte has largely refrained from such crass remarks against American officials in recent years, meanwhile, Manila has restored the VFA shortly after its suspension with new terms.<sup>38</sup> With the potential for future cooperation being so great, Washington should view hiccups and obstacles as challenges to overcome, rather than deterrents.
