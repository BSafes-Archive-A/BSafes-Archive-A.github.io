## United States Development Efforts in the Philippines
In the context of American rebuilding efforts after an immensely destructive World War II, the Europe-focused Marshall Plan stands as the most salient. In 1946, Washington enacted a similar plan in the Philippines under the name Bell Trade Act, which secured $800 million in funds to rebuild the Philippines and lay down the groundwork for future prosperity. This act was not without its strings, however, as it effectively forced the Philippines to surrender much of its national sovereignty. Under this act, the United States boasted far more control over the Philippines’ currency exchange rate and gave preferential treatment to American businesses, with one contemporary suggesting that “the United States is actually in a stronger position in the Philippines although the islands are independent now.” <sup>17</sup> The predatory nature of this act was lessened extensively upon its revision with the Laurel-Langley agreement of 1955, lasting up until 1974, giving a more just (though still far from perfect) share of prosperity to the archipelago. <sup>18</sup>

One obstacle in further cooperation has long been the limit of foreign ownership of land in the Philippines to 40 percent, among other restrictions. <sup>19</sup> Though this restriction may act as a barrier on the premises regarding profitability for outside investors, there is a clear justification for the contentious nature of the Philippines’ actions towards maintaining national sovereignty. Despite Washington currently lacking with physical infrastructure investment in the Philippines, the advancement of electronic infrastructure (particularly regarding the establishment of 5G) poses itself as a prominent linkage.

With the 2019 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum, of which the United States was an observer, it was noted in a formal dialogue that “[t]hree main partners have emerged for ASEAN to help strengthen cybersecurity: Japan, the United States, and the European Union.”<sup>20</sup> Additionally, the United States and a large Philippine telecommunications firm signed an agreement for a $1 million contract regarding the expansion of 5G, a staple of a possible emergent trend between the two nations. <sup>21</sup> As the Philippines transitions into an uppermiddle-income economy, access to the internet for the majority of citizens is a certain eventuality and one that must be met with meticulous planning of potential infrastructure, further highlighting the importance of concerted efforts.

Moreover, cooperation has also emerged in the realm of vaccinations for the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Despite China's global reach of Sinovac vaccines and the Philippines’ integration in the BRI, the United States has taken the lead in distributing vaccines with over 33.3 million given through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access program as of March 2022. <sup>22</sup> Finally, according to the United States Agency for International Development, levels of humanitarian aid also remain high, with a figure of $4.5 billion total assistance with the official goal of development. <sup>23</sup>
