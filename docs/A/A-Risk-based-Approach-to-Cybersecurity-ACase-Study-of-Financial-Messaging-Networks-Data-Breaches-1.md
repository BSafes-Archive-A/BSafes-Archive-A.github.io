## BACKGROUND INTRODUCTION
The SWIFT is an international messaging network for conducting financial transactions. Since founded in 1973, the network has grown from 239 customer banks to over 11,000 financial institutions across 200 countries. However, the cybersecurity measures implemented in the SWIFT network seemingly could not keep abreast with its rapid growth and expansion. For instance, during the last decade or so we have witnessed a string of cybercrimes targeting the SWIFT member banks that resulted in the loss of millions of dollars. The SWIFT messaging system has been regarded as the “weakest link” in a banking ecosystem. One of the major motivations of this study is to investigate various SWIFT data breach cases and seek root causes of those breaches. Particularly, the study aims to identify the gap between the extant state of SWIFT as an electronic banking platform and the desired state of fund transferring processes. By examining vulnerabilities associated with the SWIFT banking platform, this paper is to draw more attentions to current security postures that financial institutions take and their impacts on data privacy and security, the reputations of these institutions, and ultimately global banking.

The strategic goal of this research is to assess the vulnerability level in an international banking system to cyberattacks, and examine the necessity for financial institutions to form global alliances to safeguard their systems. By presenting the case studies on a series of cyberattacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the SWIFT system, this paper illustrates the importance of conducting risk assessment plans in financial institutions when facing with advanced, persistent threats (APTs).

The rest of the paper will review a series of data breaches on the SWIFT network and their impacts. The threat and vulnerability factors faced by SWIFT member banks are assessed and the level of cyber risks within the banking and payments sector are examined as well. Further, existing regulations are reviewed based on an extensive survey of the current industry practices. Countermeasures taken by the SWIFT are discussed next, followed by a step-by-step illustration of integrating a risk management framework into the SWIFT Customer Security Control Program. The last section reiterates the importance of developing a cybersecurity culture and outlines an overarching work plan by SWIFT member banks.
