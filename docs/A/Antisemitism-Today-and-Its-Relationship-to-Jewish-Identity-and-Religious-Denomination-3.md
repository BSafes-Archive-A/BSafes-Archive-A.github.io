## CHAPTER THREE
### Introduction
The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between Jewish identity and experiences with antisemitism, the relationship between Jewish denomination and experiences with antisemitism, and the type of antisemitism (religiously based antisemitism, ethnically motivated antisemitism, and anti-Zionism) Jews tend to experience most often. Understanding the relationships between these factors has implications for professional counselors and counselor educators, as ethnic identity and experiences with discrimination influence an individual´s well-being and mental health (Phinney et al., 2007). Thus, this research study was designed to contribute to the existing literature on Jewish identity and the impact of antisemitism and to address current gaps related to the prevalence of different types of antisemitism (ethnic, religious, or anti-Zionism). The methods described in this chapter were designed to answer the following research questions:

1. What is the relationship between Jewish identity (religious and ethnic) and experiences of antisemitism? 
    Hypothesis 1: Jews who report a higher level of religious and ethnic identity are more likely to experience greater antisemitism. 

2. What is the relationship between Jewish religious affiliation and experiences of antisemitism? 
    Hypothesis 2.1: Jews who are affiliated with the Orthodox stream of Judaism are more likely to experience greater antisemitism than Jews who are part of the Conservative movement. 
    Hypothesis 2.2: Conservative Jews are more likely to experience greater antisemitism than Reform Jews.

3. What, if any, type of antisemitism (e.g., ethnically or religiously based antisemitism or anti-Zionism) do Jewish individuals experience most often?

### Method
The primary purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between Jewish identity and antisemitism and Jewish denomination and antisemitism. Additionally, this study provided information related to the prevalence of different types of antisemitism (ethnic, religious, or anti-Zionism) experienced by Jewish individuals. I chose a quantitative, descriptive, and correlational research design with participants who self-identify as Jews, as I was interested in determining if there is a relationship between each of the two independent variables (Jewish identity, Jewish denomination) and the dependent variable (antisemitism) and the strength of these relationships. The goal of descriptive research studies, such as my study, is to provide a description and knowledge of the nature of a particular concept or issue (Heppner, Wampold, & Kivlighan, 2008).

I used a correlational design to investigate the strengths of the relationship between antisemitism and Jewish identity and the relationship between antisemitism and Jewish denomination. Correlational research designs usually are used to explore the strengths or magnitude of the relationship between two variables (Fitzgerald, Rumrill, & Schenker, 2004). It is important to note that correlational designs can only provide information related to the strengths of a relationship; they do not allow for the establishment of a causal relationship between the independent and dependent variables (Monette, Sullivan, & DeJong, 2005). This type of inferential analysis tends to be used by researchers to predict population parameters based on a sample (Heppner et al., 2008).

#### Participants
I included in my sample only individuals who self-identified as Jews. This included Jews by birth (at least one Jewish parent) as well as Jews by choice who officially converted to Judaism. I made this decision as Reform Judaism, unlike Conservative and Orthodox Judaism, recognizes patrilineal Jewish decedents as Jews (Ferziger, 2009). Participants needed to be 18 years or older. I collected data from Jews who are affiliated with one of the three major streams of Judaism (Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox Judaism), unaffiliated Jews, and Jews who are affiliated with another stream and who reside in the U.S.

#### Sampling Procedure
This study relied on convenience sampling. Convenience sampling refers to the composition of a sample based on individuals who are readily available (Monette et al., 2005). I relied on convenience sampling, as it is considered a legitimate method of sampling. To collect data, I contacted numerous Jewish religious institutions of each branch (Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox synagogues) and one secular Jewish cultural center (JCC) in New Jersey and New York. In addition, I contacted Hillel at Montclair State University and recruited participants through them. I started by contacting my current rabbi (Conservative) and two of my former rabbis (Conservative) via e-mail or in person to find out if they would permit me to send my survey to members of their synagogue via the member network. To recruit Orthodox Jews and Reform Jews, I contacted friends and acquaintances who are part of the Orthodox or Reform movements to get in touch with the clergy of their synagogues to discuss the possibility of using their member network to distribute my survey. I got in touch with individuals I knew who work at the ADL and with JCCs in New York and New Jersey to recruit participants. Lastly, I included in the e-mail I sent out a request to forward my survey to other individuals participants knew and who would be interested in participating in my study. This resulted in some participants posting my survey on social media. The e-mail I sent out contained information about the purpose of the study, the benefits and risks of participation as well as the time it takes to answer all survey questions. A copy of the recruitment e-mail is included as Appendix A.

I advised that participation in this study was voluntary, and it was okay to drop out at any point. The members accessed the survey through an embedded link, which led them to the online survey. In the e-mail description of the survey, I engaged in snowball sampling by asking participants to forward the link to my survey to other Jewish individuals they knew. According to Monette et al. (2005), snowball sampling is “useful for sampling subcultures where the members routinely interact with one another” (p. 147).

I aimed at having around 300 participants to ensure that after the cleaning of the data I still had enough participants for the analysis. Statistical power is an essential aspect of the data analysis to avoid making a Type I or Type II error (Heppner et al., 2008). According to Heppner et al. (2008), the increase in statistical power can be achieved by using a bigger sample. Ideally, I wanted to include about 100 participants for each of the three major movements. In the end I had a total of 408 participants. However, out of the 408, 279 participants filled out the first two parts of the survey, and only 222 participants filled out the entire survey. Based on the GPower calculation I conducted the suggested sample size was 262 participants to ensure statistical power. Thus, my sample size for the first two questions was sufficient.

### Instrumentation
My study used cross-sectional data, which was collected at one point in time via an online survey. I used the American Jewish Identity Scale (AJIS) to measure the independent variable, Jewish identity (religious and ethnic identity). In addition, I developed a questionnaire based on a survey (Discrimination and Hate Crimes Against Jews in EU Member States: Experiences and Perceptions of Antisemitism) created by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) to collect descriptive data about participants such as Jewish denomination (independent variable) and demographic characteristics (confounding variables). The demographic questions addressed sex, age, education level, income level, state of residence, and geographic description (e.g., rural, suburban, urban). The questionnaire also contained items related to experiences with different types of antisemitism, anti-Zionism, and religiously and ethnically based antisemitism. The General Ethnic Discrimination (GED) Scale was used to measure the dependent variable (antisemitism). The GED was developed to examine the role of discrimination in different ethnic groups and was used in my study to look at the experience of Jewish individuals related to antisemitism (Landrine, Klonoff, Corral, Fernandez, & Roesch, 2006).

#### American Jewish Identity Scale (AJIS)
The AJIS is a 33-item self-report survey of Jewish identity. It was developed to measure Jewish ethnic and religious identity (Friedlander et al., 2010). The AJIS measures Jewish identity through two subscales, the Cultural Identification scale (CI) and the Religious Identification scale (RI; Friedlander et al., 2010). Of the 33 items on the AJIS, 18 items are for the RI scale and 15 for the CI scale. The instrument uses a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from (1) not at all true for me to (4) very true for me. Example questions on the AJIS are: "A member of my household lights candles on Sabbath" (religious) and "As a Jew, I feel like an outsider" (cultural). High scores on the RI subscale indicated a strong religious identity and high scores on the CI suggested a strong cultural identity. For more information about the AJIS please view Appendix C.

Three studies were conducted to develop the brief self-report and to investigate the psychometric properties of the AJIS (Friedlander et al., 2010). According to Friedlander et al. (2010), the first study focused on content validity. The expert panel aiding with the content validity consisted of nine individuals, including four counseling psychologists, one Jewish studies scholar, a director of a secular Jewish organization, and one rabbi each from the Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform movements. The second study used confirmatory factor analysis based on the completed AJIS forms of 1,884 Jewish adults. The third study was used to assess the short-term stability of the AJIS (Friedlander et al., 2010).

**Reliability and validity.** The AJIS is considered to be reliable and valid (Friedlander et al., 2010). Content validity was established using an expert panel. Construct validity for the RI was determined by comparing the RI scores of participants based on their affiliation. Friedlander et al. (2010) “reasoned that support for the construct validity of RI would be evidenced if Orthodox Jews scored higher than Conservative and Reform Jews” (p. 349). This reasoning was supported by the test results of the AJIS and is consistent with existing literature related to Jewish religious identity.

The study by Friedlander et al. (2010) provides empirical evidence of internal consistency for the AJIS. The Cronbach 𝛼𝛼 for the overall instrument is .95. The Cronbach α for the CI scale is .88, and for the RI scale, it is .93. Test-retest reliability was significant. Overall, the AJIS has been demonstrated to be valid and reliable. No other studies were found that used the AJIS that could provide further evidence related to the reliability or validity of the instrument.

#### Questionnaire
The questionnaire was used to collect descriptive data related to demographic characteristics such as Jewish denomination (independent variable), age, sex, level of education (confounding variable), and items to identify the types of antisemitism experienced by the participants (e.g., anti-Zionism, religiously and ethnic/racially based antisemitism). The questionnaire is divided into two parts. The first part of the questionnaire contains demographic questions inquiring about sex, age, level of education, income, religious affiliation, state of residence and area type of residence. The second part of the questionnaire poses questions related to experiences with antisemitism.

The following questions are sample questions that I asked to answer my third research question related to experiences with different types of antisemitism: "To what extent, if at all, does the Israeli-Arab conflict impact on how safe you feel as a Jewish person?" (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2013, p. 40). “What type of discrimination do you believe to be the most problematic?” Participants answered these questions by checking appropriate boxes or by rating their answer based on a Likert scale or by rating their answers with numbers from (1) most problematic to (3) least problematic. The questions were modeled after the survey created by the FRA or taken directly from the survey to ensure that the questions used appropriate terminology and were easy to understand. The complete questionnaire is included at the end of this dissertation as Appendix E.

National and international policy actors and representatives of Jewish community organizations created the survey on antisemitism and the Jewish people (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2013). Members of a panel of academic experts in the fields of antisemitism and Jewish population studies were asked for advice related to terminology used in the questionnaire due to the sensitive nature of the research topic (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2013). Additionally, FRA hired a survey research company to work on the survey. The survey was piloted in a variety of countries in Europe before the final questionnaire was sent out to the Jewish communities in the European Union (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2013). Thus, the questions presented in the questionnaire created by the EU have been tested and are considered appropriate to collect data about Jews and their experiences with antisemitism.

#### General Ethnic Discrimination (GED) Scale
The GED by Landrine et al. (2006) is an 18-item self-report survey and measures perceived ethnic discrimination and will be used to measure my dependent variable of antisemitism. According to Landrine et al. (2006), the GED is a slightly modified version of the Schedule of Racist Events. Changes were related to the stem of questions, which were generalized by changing words such as “black” to “race/ethnic group” (Landrine et al., 2006, p. 83). The instructions and the ratings of the frequency of discriminatory events were shortened and simplified to accommodate non-English native speakers. The entire questionnaire can be found at the end of the dissertation under Appendix D.

The GED measures perceived ethnic discrimination through three subscales, the Recent Discrimination, Lifetime Discrimination, and Appraised Discrimination scales (Landrine et al., 2006). The GED contains 18 items with sub-questions for each of the three scales. The instrument uses two 6-point Likert-type scales ranging from (1) never to (6) almost all the time and (1) not at all stressful to (6) extremely stressful. Higher scores suggest a higher level of perceived discrimination, while lower scores imply a lower level of perceived discrimination. Example questions are: "How often have you been treated unfairly by teachers and professors because of your race/ethnic group?" "How often in the past year?" "How often in your entire life?" "How stressful was this for you?"

The study by Landrine et al. (2006) with 1,596 participants (African American, Asian American, Latino/Hispanic, and White American) investigated the psychometric properties of the GED and compared it to the psychometric properties of the original scale the GED was modeled after. It appears that the GED has similar psychometric properties to the Schedule of Racist Events (Landrine et al., 2006).

**Reliability and validity.** The GED is considered to be reliable and valid (Landrine et al., 2006). The construct validity of the instrument and its three subscales is significant and similar to the subscales of the Schedule of Racist Events (Landrine et al., 2006). The subscales appear to be reliable for each of the four ethnic groups that participated in the study and range from Cronbach α .91 - .94. Hwang and Goto (2008) used the GED in a subsequent study, which supported the validity and reliability of the instrument. They employed the GED for their research on “the impact of perceived racial discrimination on the mental health of Asian American and Latino college students” (Hwang & Goto, 2008, p. 326).

As discussed earlier, for most ethnic groups, religious identity is separate from ethnic identity. Thus, it is not surprising that the GED does not contain any questions related to perceived religious discrimination. It appears that currently, there is no instrument available that measures the perceived discrimination of ethno-religious groups. Since Jews are an ethnoreligious group and may experience discrimination based on ethnicity and religion, with written permission from the author of the GED, I replaced the words “race and ethnicity” with “Jewish” to cover the entire spectrum of discrimination for Jews, including religious bias.

### Procedures
Upon approval from the Montclair State University Institutional Review Board (IRB), I conducted a pilot study with four participants (Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and unaffiliated individual) to determine the time it takes to complete the survey and to determine if any modifications to the survey items were necessary. A copy of the approval from the IRB is included as Appendix F at the end of the final dissertation.

I combined the AJIS, GED, and the questionnaire by using the survey creation tool Qualtrics. Qualtrics is free of charge for all faculty and students at Montclair State University. Once the survey was completed, I sent it via e-mail to rabbis from the three major Jewish movements and contacts at ADL asking for permission to distribute my survey to potential participants in their networks. The e-mail contained information about the goal of my research study, the time it takes to complete the survey along with potential risks and benefits, and a link that will lead participants to a consent form. After reading and signing the consent form participants were directed to the actual questionnaire. Participants remained anonymous. Once the data collection was completed the information was saved on my laptop and protected with a password. Each participant was assigned an identification number to ensure anonymity and to manage the data set effectively. The complete survey, the sample e-mail, as well as the consent form (appendix B) are included at the end of the study.

### Data Analysis 
The collected data was transferred from Qualtrics to SPSS. SPSS is a software program that is used to analyze data. I used SPSS to clean the data. According to Monette et al. (2005), before starting the analysis of the data set, it is crucial to clean the data to avoid distortion of the findings. I used SPSS to generate frequency distributions for each variable, which made it easier to detect variables that are out-of-range or values that should not be present in the first place (Monette et al., 2005).

I started the analysis of the data by focusing first on the relationship between Jewish religious identity and Jewish ethnic identity (independent variable) and antisemitism (dependent variable). Then, I analyzed the relationship between Jewish denomination (independent variable) and antisemitism (dependent variable) using SPSS. Correlational designs are used to explore relationships among variables that are not manipulated or cannot be manipulated (Fitzgerald et al., 2004). This step allowed me to generate a correlation coefficient, which allowed me to infer the strengths and direction of the relationship between the independent and dependent variable. The correlation coefficient (r) is a number ranging from +1.00 (strong positive relationship) to -1.00 (strong negative relationship; Heppner et al., 2008). A correlation coefficient around 0 points to a weak relationship between variables (Fitzgerald et al., 2004). I will report the correlation coefficients for my study in the results section of chapter four.

I used linear regression models to predict the outcome variable (antisemitism) based on the value of the independent variables (Jewish identity and denomination). Regression is used to establish the degree to which an independent variable influences the dependent variable (Monette et al., 2005). To control for potential confounding variables, such as age, level of education, and gender, I ran a multiple linear regression. I chose age and level of education as a confounding variable as current research provides evidence that older individuals tend to perceive antisemitism as more problematic than younger individuals (Cohen, 2010; Rebhun, 2014). Gender was chosen as a confounding variable because women and men have distinct roles in Judaism. By controlling for these confounding variables, it was possible to isolate them and thus analyze the unique effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable (Monette et al., 2005). In the end, this study allowed for the measurement and analysis of the relationship. It indicated the impact of multiple variables, the independent (Jewish identity, Jewish denomination) and the control variables (e.g., age, gender, education) on the dependent variable (antisemitism). The results of the regression analysis will be presented in chapter four.

To avoid Type I errors (rejecting the null hypothesis that is true) and Type II errors (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false), the alpha level should be neither too stringent nor too lax (Heppner et al., 2008). According to Monette et al. (2005) social sciences commonly use an alpha level of .05. Thus, the level of significance for my study was set at alpha .05.

### Chapter Summary
This chapter contains a description of the methods and procedures I used to complete my study. This chapter includes my three research questions, information about who my potential participants are as well as a description of the instruments I used to collect data. Moreover, it includes an overview of how the data were analyzed. In the next chapter I will present the results of the data analyses.
