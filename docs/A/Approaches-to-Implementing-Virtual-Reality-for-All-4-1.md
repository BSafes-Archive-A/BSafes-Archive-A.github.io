## Design Considerations
Before focusing on the hardware and software that will be utilized, an important next step is to identify the goals and purpose of the VR experience. According to Jowallah, et al. (2018), “the planning process should begin outside of the technology considerations entirely and incorporate sound planning and design principles.” By first focusing on the learning goals rather than the technology, it will be easier to determine what types of VR experiences will best align with the goals which will also help narrow the scope of your search for VR content. Developing clear learning goals for the VR activities and sharing these goals with students will give students a better understanding of why they are using VR and how the VR activities are connected to the educational goals.

Another important consideration during the design phase is the assignment design. This includes identifying the instructional strategy you would like to utilize (e.g., virtual field trips, scavenger hunts), designing the student experience and determining any desired affective responses (e.g., hearing other perspectives, having an emotional response). Identifying these elements of the assignment will provide helpful guidance as you search for and test VR experiences to make sure they align with the goals of the activity. Other important elements of assignment design include writing directions, reflection questions, or discussion prompts for students to respond to during and/or after the VR experience and determining if students will work individually, with partners, or in groups.

In addition, different course modalities present different challenges when designing VR experiences. For example, when reviewing or implementing VR activities for face-to-face courses, technology may be provided to students to utilize. However, there may be situations where there is not enough technology for all students to participate at once. It may be beneficial for students to pair up when using this technology when there is limited hardware available. Additional benefits of small groups of students engaging in VR experiences together is the opportunity for deeper discussions and allowing students to guide and help each other while using the equipment. Implementing VR activities for fully online courses where students are remote may be possible utilizing a bring-your-own device model; however, this presents challenges since some students may not have access to the required technology.
