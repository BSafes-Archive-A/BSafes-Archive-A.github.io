## 4. CONCLUSION
This paper has examined current research on knowledge risks and knowledge risk management. The concept of knowledge risks is still in its infancy, and existing research provided a fragmented understanding of the topic. This study provided a thorough theoretical overview and assessment of knowledge risk concept. As a result, the theoretical viewpoints on knowledge risks were collated and analysed. Durst and Zieba (2018) classification was chosen because of its comprehensiveness, clarity, and flexibility when compared to others such as Lambe (2003) or Trkman & Desouza (2012). A new knowledge risk taxonomy has been established as an extension of this knowledge risk classification. The strategic knowledge risk group has been added to the taxonomy. This study argued that some knowledge risks, such as knowledge loss and knowledge leakage, which are not included in Durst and Zieba (2018)'s classification, as well as risks associated with knowledge gaps, can be classified as strategic knowledge risks. A new holistic taxonomy is provided by adding strategic knowledge risks as a new group, which may motivate and guide future study in this field. Strategic knowledge risks have long-term consequences for operations and performance. This study is the first to distinguish between operational knowledge risks, which must be controlled by functional/operational managers, and strategic knowledge risks, which must be managed by top management/executives. The field of knowledge risks has immense research potential, and the suggested taxonomy lays the groundwork for future research. The taxonomy has not been empirically validated, which is the study's main limitation. Next step will be to test this taxonomy within certain group of firms such as knowledge-intensive firms, whose performance is largely dependent on effective knowledge management.
