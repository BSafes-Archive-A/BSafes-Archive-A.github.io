## CONCLUSION
Companies in the financial services industries keep remaining a high-profile target for cybercriminals and APT groups. A series of data breach cases targeting the SWIFT system presented in our paper corroborate that the international banking system is a lot more vulnerable to cyberattacks than previously understood. This study presents an opportunity for banks to embrace new security mindsets and change their risk management processes as it relates to information protection, data retention, and network architecture. For some banks, this change could be incremental, while those without the right infrastructure will have some considerable climb to make in a short period of time. Larger banks could have many of the requirements already in place, but also have a lot of complexity and legacy systems or processes to overcome while smaller banks with fewer resources, especially those in less developed countries, may face challenges implementing them on time. 

To address the concerns of SWIFT network security and prevent potential cyberattacks targeting the financial services and insurance industries, the author suggests the SWIFT member banks to integrate the NIST risk management framework into the security controls mandated by the CSCF. The NIST RMF, which presents a holistic and a comprehensive risk management process, can be tailored as needed and applied throughout an enterprise as a practical and useful approach to fortify networks.

This study has been mainly focused on APT groups’ attack methods and patterns with most of the information obtained from secondary data, thus, leaving the study of insider actors outside the scope of the paper. It is noted that SWIFT or the affected banks have not made the full details publicly available on their sites due to concerns of reputational embarrassment. It could be interesting to consider these breaches from a different perspective, such as analyzing insider actors and their roles in the breaches if more relevant information would be made public.

Financial institutions need to interact and transact with various stakeholders and counterparties on a daily basis. Therefore, cybersecurity risks need to be managed together with other types of risk (e.g. operational, financial, and regulatory) and integrated into an organization’s existing risk assessment processes. It is crucial for financial institutions to make a collective effort in taking proper precautions to safeguard the banking and payment ecosystem. In addition to the NIST RMF, further research on a couple of other active response and defense frameworks would be beneficial, including the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis (Caltagirone, Pendergast, & Betz, 2013), kill chain modeling of APTs (U.S. Department of Defence, 2013), and corresponding response of the attacks.
