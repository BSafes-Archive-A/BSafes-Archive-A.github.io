## ABSTRACT
ANTISEMITISM TODAY AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO JEWISH IDENTITY AND RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION

By Michaela Ambrosius

The purpose of this research study was to answer the following three research questions: 1) What is the relationship between Jewish identity (religious and ethnic) and experiences of antisemitism? 2) What is the relationship between Jewish religious affiliation and experiences of antisemitism? 3) What, if any, type of antisemitism (e.g., ethnic or religiously based antisemitism or anti-Zionism) do Jewish individuals experience most often? Antisemitism continues to be a pervasive issue in the United States (U.S.) and can be based on ethnic prejudice, religious bias, or anti-Israel attitudes. The final sample for this study included 279 participants who self-identified as Jewish. The results of correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis suggest that there is a significant relationship between experiences with antisemitism and Jewish ethnic identity and religious identity, and that both play a vital part in predicting experiences with antisemitism. This dissertation includes an overview of the study, a literature review, a description of the methodology, an analysis of the results, as well as a discussion about the implications for counselors and counselor educators.

*Keywords:* antisemitism, Jewish identity, Jewish denominations, anti-Zionism 

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Writing a dissertation is challenging and, at the same time, a rewarding experience. It is challenging because it takes hard work, persistence, patience, and high frustration tolerance. I have read articles, books, and some more articles and reports about antisemitism. I have spent countless hours alone, sitting in front of my computer writing and re-writing parts of my dissertation. Discussing antisemitism and its impact on the Jewish community while experiencing it in my private life has been, at times, emotionally exhausting. However, now that I am done with my dissertation, I feel a sense of accomplishment and am glad I did it. My dissertation committee played an essential role in making my dissertation a successful project.

Thank you, Dr. Levitt, for being there for me from the beginning. I could not have had a better advisor and dissertation chair! Without your support, feedback, commitment, and guidance, this dissertation could not have happened. You listened to me, kept me going, and pushed me when I needed it. Words cannot express how thankful I am for everything you did for me. I would also like to thank Dr. Kooyman for challenging me to get immersed in my data and for helping to address some critical issues. A big thank you also to Dr. Glosoff for your thorough feedback and the good times during CSI meetings. Thank you also to Dr. Goldfarb for opening up my eyes to the importance of positionality.

Vorrei anche ringraziare alla mia famiglia, sopratutto a mia madre e Pasquale. Ein herzliches Dankeschön auch an meine Schwester, Basti, Julian und Ava. Eure Videos waren und sind immer wieder eine süße Abwechslung vom Alltag. Danke auch an Tanja und ihre Familie für die Unterstüzung und die vielen schönen Sabatfeiern. A big thank you also to Emmanuel for your emotional support and for your expertise in all things computers! Lastly, a big shout out to my friends Kelly, Anna, Nicole, Candice and Iliana for fun evenings, discussions and writing retreats.
