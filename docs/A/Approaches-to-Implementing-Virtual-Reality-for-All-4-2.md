## Hardware Considerations
The modality of the course and the VR software being utilized will help determine the hardware requirements for the VR experience. If students are in the same physical location, a computer lab or shared devices (e.g., mobile device, cardboard headset) may be utilized. Alternatively, a bring-your-own device model could be utilized. If the students are remote, it is important to survey students and ask if they have access to a mobile device and other hardware required for the assignment to identify hardware limitations they may have and how they will interact with the VR content. A few questions for you to answer as you determine the hardware requirements and the level to which you can implement VR in your course are provided below:

Questions to consider when determining hardware requirements: 
- Do students have access to a mobile device? 
    - If you are asking students to install a VR app on their personal device, do they have the permissions and space to do so?
    - For face-to-face courses: You may consider having a mobile device with the VR app pre-loaded for students to use in class as a back-up for those who cannot install the app.

- If students do not have access to a mobile device or cannot use the mobile device due to accessibility concerns, is the VR experience also accessible via a web browser? 

- Will students have access to a VR headset (e.g., cardboard)?
    - If not, how will they view the VR content?

- If audio elements are included in the VR content, do students have access to headphones to make the experience more immersive? 

- Do students have access to a safe space to interact with VR content? 
    - If movement is involved, is the space large enough? 
    - If students sit to view the VR content, will they be able to turn 360 degrees to view all areas of the content if necessary?

As suggested in the accessibility considerations section above, it is highly recommended to test the hardware in conjunction with the software prior to students engaging with the VR activity. For example, the quality of cardboard headsets varies greatly. Lower quality cardboard headsets may cause visual issues (e.g., lenses that are difficult to see through) for individuals that do not have visual impairments. If you are purchasing cardboard headsets for use in class or making a recommendation to your students to purchase one for use at home, test the headset to ensure the lenses are of good quality and do not impair vision. Testing specific VR content while using a cardboard headset with a mobile device will also help identify other challenges (e.g., auto-dimming on the mobile device, determine whether captions can be read) that students may face when engaging in the VR activity. Identifying these issues upfront and sharing these with your students can help reduce barriers and frustration for students.

Another area to test while keeping accessibility in mind is the built-in VR navigation menu. When testing use of the menu to select other VR content while using the cardboard headset, make note of the types of movements this requires (e.g., turning your body and/or head, moving the device to a specific area to locate the menu, hovering over a menu item to select). This may be challenging for students with physical disabilities or motion sickness. Recognizing that the physical movements required to interact with VR may present for some students will help you proactively plan accommodations for students if needed.
