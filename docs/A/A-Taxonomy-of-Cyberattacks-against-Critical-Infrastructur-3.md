## BACKGROUND LITERATURE
### Cybercrime
Like traditional crime, cybercrime has many different facets and occurs in various environments and scenarios. When it comes to defining the term “cybercrime”, there have been multiple attempts and the definition itself evolves over time due to the changes in technology, its growing implementation in society, and the impact of using various tools and devices in our lives. For example, The Council of Europe’s Cybercrime Treaty uses the term “Cybercrime” to refer to offences ranging from criminal activity against data to content and copyright infringement (Krone, 2005). However, Zeviar-Geese (1997) suggests that the definition is broader, including activities such as fraud, unauthorized access, child pornography, and cyberstalking. The United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer Related Crime (United Nations, 1995) includes fraud, forgery, and unauthorized access in its cybercrime definition. Gordon and Ford (2006) define cybercrime as: “any crime that is facilitated or committed using a computer, network, or hardware device” (p. 14).

The National Research Council (2009) described cyberattacks as “deliberate computer-to-computer attacks that disrupt, disable, destroy, or take over a computer system, or damage or steal the information it contains” (p. 1). The umbrella term “cyberattack” can include any of the following: infecting computers and networks with viruses and worms that control, slow down or damage computers, exploiting spyware to probe for vulnerabilities or steal data, and conducting denial of service attacks, with or without the assistance of botnets, to overwhelm websites and networks by flooding them with junk communications. Cyberattacks exclude physical assaults on computers using other weapons, such as destroying computers with hammers or explosives (Kenney, 2015). According to the National Research Council (2009), cyberattacks are computer attacks on other computers carried out in cyberspace, including the Internet, telecommunications infrastructures, and computer systems. The immediate objective of a cyberattack may be to harm the computer targeted, steal information from it, or simply observe the system to exploit vulnerabilities for a subsequent attack. The key is that the attacker conducts the intrusion with hostile, if not necessarily destructive, intent – without the knowledge or consent of the victim.

However, the problem with all these definitions is that they are very broad and do not contain many discriminating properties to classify them more specifically. This lack of differentiation may also lead to disparities in the potential sentencing procedures when it comes to prosecuting hackers. Furthermore, the perpetrators of cyberattacks can be states or non-state actors, the damage caused by the attack can be extensive or minuscule, and the attack’s purpose may be to achieve almost any economic, political, social, or psychological objective (Kenney, 2015).

### Cyberterrorism
Cyberterrorism, or cyberwarfare, is much less frequent compared to cybercrimes and cyberattacks. These are typically carried out by entire states who launch repeated computer attacks against their adversaries to deny them the ability to use cyberspace effectively, while safeguarding their own ability to do the same. Such attacks are known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). The term “APT” emerged in the last 10 years and it has been associated with a new type of insidious threats that use multiple attack techniques and vectors, and that are conducted by stealth to avoid detection so that hackers can retain control over target systems unnoticed for long periods of time (Tankard, 2011).

Cyberwarfare refers to offensive computer assaults that seek to damage or destroy adversaries’ networks and infrastructures or deter them from waging cyberattacks of their own. Like conventional warfare, cyberwarfare is instrumental: belligerents seek to impose their will on their enemies by attacking them in pursuit of some political goal or objective (Clausewitz, 1976). Unlike traditional warfare, cyberwarfare occurs exclusively in cyberspace. The physical acts of destroying virtual networks by bombing computer servers or telecommunications cables are now taking place in the cyberspace.

Cyberwarfare is largely, but not exclusively, the domain of states. States, and private hackers that act on their behalf, view cyberwarfare as a tool through which they can advance their national interests. This virtual continuation of policy by other means is still less violent than traditional warfare, leading some observers to declare that cyberwarfare is not “real.” In one version of this argument, cyberwar is not real war because cyberweapons lack their “own force or energy” (Rid, 2013, p. 81).

Because information about cyberterrorism and cyberterrorists is generally considered classified and cannot be released to the public, the public can usually only infer that cyberterrorism and cyberterrorists exist. However, in 2010 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) chief, Robert Mueller, told an RSA Conference of computer security professionals, ‘‘The cyber-terrorism threat is real and rapidly expanding’’. He indicated that terrorists have shown a clear interest in hacking skills and combining real attacks with cyberattacks (Hua & Bapna, 2013).

APT is a critical component of cyberterrorist attacks. Tankard (2011) defines the term as “a new breed of insidious threats that use multiple attack techniques and vectors and that are conducted by stealth to avoid detection so that hackers can retain control over target systems unnoticed for long periods of time” (p. 16). Furthermore, he explains that traditional defenses aimed at keeping known threats out of the network are no longer sufficient against the exploits being used to conduct such attacks. Tankard (2011) insists that the focus should be on “developing a defense in depth strategy that aims to constantly monitor networks and security controls for their effectiveness” (p. 16). These advanced persistent threats are the main weapon of cyberterrorists and in order to launch such an attack, one must be supported by the infrastructure of an entire country. Since there are not that many powerful countries in the world in terms of their cyber capabilities, it could be easy to identify the offenders based on the current socio-political context in the world because often these crimes are triggered by certain political and economic events. However, proving beyond reasonable doubt in front of an international court that a particular country committed the crime is essentially impossible.

### Hacker Motivation

Generally, cyberterrorists are considered a subgroup of hackers (Beveren, 2001; Rogers, 1999). What differentiates them from hackers is their motivation. Typically, cyberterrorists are politically or religiously motivated and similar to the examples we have seen in the physical world – their goal is to create fear and panic among civilians and disrupt or destroy public and private infrastructure (Hua & Bapna, 2013).

Sometimes cyberterrorists may also try to coerce a targeted government to negotiate with them, or show their existence to their community, or demonstrate their capabilities to their political and financial supporters (Embar-Seddon, 2002; Verton & Brownlow, 2003). Furthermore, as Poremba (2011) points out, “Unlike viruses or computer attacks that result in a denial of service a cyberterrorist attack is designed to cause physical violence or extreme financial harm”. In contrast, common hackers’ motivations include addiction to hacking, curiosity, intention to gain power, peer recognition and the sense of belonging to a group (Beveren, 2001). Increasingly, the motivation is to make money (Aaronson, 2005) and some cases from the U.S. Department of Justice are showing that most hackers tried to make money from their hacking (Hua & Bapna, 2013). Generally, a skilled hacker may attack the same target as a cyberterrorist; however, the cyberterrorist would typically have more resources than the hacker to support long-term uninterrupted attacks or APTs (Furnell & Warren, 1999; Quigley, 2007). This evidence only comes to show the growing impact of cyberterrorism on our society and the pressing need to develop new policies that would provide international law enforcement agencies with the necessary legal frameworks to investigate and prosecute cybercrimes and cyberterrorism.

When it comes to the motivation of any cybercriminals, there are three basic aspects. They could be inspired by the political, socio-cultural, or economical contexts. Gandhi et al. (2011) describe this phenomenon as a Venn diagram, and they provide examples of each type of hacker motivation.

Cyber criminals involved in politically motivated attacks can be members of extremist groups who use cyberspace to spread propaganda, attack websites and networks of their political enemies, steal money to fund their activities, or plan and coordinate physical-world crime (Cross & Shinder, 2008). Based on the nature of an attack, politically motivated attacks can be further subdivided as: protests against political actions, protests against laws or public documents, and outrage against acts related to physical violence (Gandhi et al., 2011).

Economic situations and personal or corporate financial greed often provide motives for cyberattacks. Cyber mercenaries and organized cartels also operate in cyberspace. Other examples of economically motivated attacks include espionage, ransomware, identity theft, piracy, electronic fraud and tax evasion, money laundering, etc. With the growing use of technology, now a new term has emerged, Crime as a Service, and it has already been ranked in the top IT security threats for 2018. Crime-as-a-Service is when a professional criminal or group of criminals develop advanced tools, which are offered up for sale or rent to other criminals or criminal-wannabes who are usually less experienced. Typically, the exchange would occur on the Darknet and it will be through some type of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin because it is anonymous and essentially untraceable.

Socio-cultural conflict can be viewed as competition between individuals or groups over incompatible goals, scarce resources, or power, including the denial of control to others (Avruch, 2009). Cross-cultural conflict can also manifest as ethnic conflict. Cyber conflicts incited for cultural reasons include conflicts between Taiwan-China (August 1999), Russia-Estonia (2007) and Russia-Georgia (2008). Similarly, the Israel-Palestine cyberconflict, where national symbols – the Israeli flag, Hebrew text, and a recording of the Israeli national anthem – were put into Hezbollah home page (Karatzogianni, 2008), belongs in this category. Gandhi et al. (2011) point out the sometimes the hackers’ motivation can also be ethical and that many cyberattacks are motivated by deeply rooted socio-cultural issues.
