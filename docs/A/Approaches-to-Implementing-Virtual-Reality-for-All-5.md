## Putting it All Together: Use Cases and Examples
### The New York Times 360 VR Video
The New York Times 360 VR Video series provides a low-cost way to introduce students to virtual reality and provides flexibility in how students access the content. These immersive videos span a variety of topics and include visual and audio elements that allow students to read text or listen to the unique perspective of a narrator as they interact with and explore the 360- degree video content. One option for students to access these videos is via the 360 VR | The New York Times YouTube channel using a web browser. Students may use the computer mouse to control their view of the 360-degree video. Although this approach is not very immersive, it provides student choice and flexibility regarding the device that is utilized (e.g., laptop, mobile device) and is ideal for students with a disability that limits their ability to hold and/or control a mobile device and a cardboard headset. Encouraging students to use headphones while engaging with this content on a web browser can slightly increase the level of immersion when using this approach (Felder & Proux, 2020). These videos also have closed captions, which students may enable if needed. Although the keyboard arrow keys will not allow students to move the 360- degree video on the screen, the main focus of the content will typically remain on the screen for the student to view while listening to the narrator.

A second and more immersive option for students to access this content is to utilize a mobile device and cardboard headset to view the 360 videos in YouTube. When accessing certain 360 videos in YouTube on a mobile device, a “Spatial Audio” prompt appears informing the user that the video utilizes a new type of sound that is best experienced with headphones. Students with cardboard headsets can tap the VR headset icon on the video in order to view the content in VR mode. Students using a mobile device and cardboard headset may enable closed captions. However, the captions may be difficult to read on a mobile device in VR mode due to the small size of the text on the screen.

The [New York Times Virtual Reality Curriculum Guide](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/learning/lesson-plans/virtual-reality-curriculum-guideexperience-immersion-and-excursion-in-the-classroom.html) offers helpful tips for getting started, lesson plans to use with specific New York Times 360 VR videos, and discussion and reflection prompts for before, during, and after the VR activities.

### Roundme
RoundMe.com is a site that has free 360 virtual tours from around the world. These virtual tours consist of one or more still images and may contain text boxes with information to read as you explore. Roundme provides a unique way for students to virtually explore other parts of the world and engage in activities such as comparing two different locations or engaging in a scavenger hunt created by the instructor or student-created scavenger hunts. Students do not need to create an account to access these virtual tours. However, users can create an account in order to create and share a virtual tour on the Roundme site. Locating virtual tours on this site can be accomplished by using the search feature, exploring the “Best New” section, or by utilizing the “World Map” feature to select and zoom in on a specific location. Similar to the NY Times VR Videos, Roundme provides multiple options for students to access the VR content. Students may use a web browser and computer mouse to view and control the content. The keyboard arrow keys may also be used to control the virtual tours, which may be a helpful accessibility feature for some students. Alternatively, students may utilize a mobile device and a cardboard headset to view the virtual tours in a more immersive setting (e.g., VR mode). The virtual tours on this site do not include audio elements; therefore, closed captions are not necessary. Roundme makes it easy to share these virtual tours on other websites by providing embed codes. This provides a lot of possibilities for students to utilize these virtual tours in digital writing and research projects.

### VR Apps
There are several VR mobile apps available to explore, test, and determine if they align with your course goals. One challenge with mobile apps is that they come and go or apps may no longer get updates, which could cause issues when using them on certain devices. Testing and vetting apps before using them in the classroom is crucial.

One example of a VR mobile app that helps the user assume a new role/perspective is the “Autism VR Experience” app. This app allows the user to experience firsthand how a child with autism experiences and feels in situations that are overstimulating. VR mobile apps such as this can provide a unique way for students to consider another perspective and learn about specific topics in an immersive environment.

As you search for and explore VR mobile apps, there are a few important things to consider:

- Is the app free or is there a cost? 

- Is the app available for both iOS and Android devices? 

- Is the app content via a web browser for students who do not have access to a mobile device? 

- Will students use shared devices in the classroom, or will they need to use their own devices?
    - If students will use their own mobile device: 
        - How much space will they need to have on their device to install the app? 
        - Do they have the permissions on the device they will use (in the situation where a student borrows a phone)? 
        - Are there privacy concerns with the app?
    - When was the app last updated? 
        - Apps that have not been updated in several years may not perform well. 
    - Does the app provide any accessibility features?
