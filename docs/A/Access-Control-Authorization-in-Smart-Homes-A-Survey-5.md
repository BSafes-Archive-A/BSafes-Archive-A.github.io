application installations in smart home environments, some smart home platforms provide solutions, such as the apple home kit, which supports two types of access: remote view access and editing modes. In remote view access mode, a user can obtain access to the connected smart home devices but cannot edit anything. In contrast, in editing mode, a user can edit remote devices, data, and applications. Other smart devices, such as Kwikset Kevo Lock and August smart lock, also support temporary access rights for guest users[44, 45]. These solutions are device and vendor specific. Therefore, they are not suitable and applicable in a complex environment with multiple devices and users. As a result, existing access control frameworks fail to satisfy such complicated multi-user and multiple device demands. For example, parents do not want their children to have access to a smart TV; the house owner wants to give temporary access to the guest room TV and light bulbs to the guest; or the need for privacy among apartment roommates means that everyone only has access to one’s own smart devices.

Suitable fine-grained access control can be designed and implemented to solve these problems[12], and several works have been completed to understand the needs and preferences of users to determine the needs and requirements of access control design in smart homes[17, 27, 46]. Recently, research[17] has been conducted among 425 users of smart homes to determine the effect of the relationship between users on access control requirements in smart homes. Other research[46] tried to understand the requirements and needs of access control in real-life smart homes. The authors[46] developed an access control prototype and measured its usability by performing a study of eight smart homeowners.

The authors in Ref. [47] mentioned use cases of access control in smart homes. For instance, all smart home members can have full access to smart devices, but that is not the case for guest users. Smart home systems have to compromise guest user access to stay within limited premises[48]. Guest users need to control light bulbs, the room temperature, the fridge, and other guest room devices. However, they should not have access to any other sensitive data or smart devices. Another common scenario concerns the external trusted people, such as a housekeeper and cleaning staff. While they have access to physical entry of the smart home and devices within the home premises (e.g., lamps, window blinds, heating, and the fridge), they obviously must also have access to the same devices in the digital world of smart homes[47]

Moreover, a police officer can sometimes request temporary access to the smart home outdoor security cameras or the door locks. Furthermore, members of the smart home temporarily leaving the city or country sometimes need remote access to the smart home.
