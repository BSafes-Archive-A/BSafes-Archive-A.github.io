## Accessibility Considerations 
As with any technology utilized in courses, regardless of modality, it is helpful to consider varying student needs and accessibility issues prior to the implementation of VR hardware/software to ensure all students can engage with the technology. While specific disabilities (e.g., visual, physical, cognitive) present varying obstacles for students engaging with VR, there are strategies that can be utilized to try to reduce these obstacles. Considering the hardware, software, and accessibility needs from the start when searching for and implementing VR activities will help ensure a successful experience for all.

Even though VR has been around for quite some time, accessibility considerations for individuals with disabilities or even for individuals with something as common as motion sickness have not always been explored for each piece of VR hardware or software. Perhaps due to an increase in accessibility awareness, access to this equipment, and/or a decrease in the cost of software and hardware, or perhaps a combination of these, this is no longer the case. (Zhao, Y. 2019). According to Aguilo, B., et al. (2019), designing accessibility features in the area of VR is still in its infancy and although the research process to improve accessibility is in progress, it is not standard practice across the board.

When planning to implement VR in your course, please consider the following possible limitations that one or more students in your class could be affected by (this is by no means an exhaustive list of limitations):

- Hearing (deaf or hard of hearing)

- Vision issues (low vision/blindness/glasses

- Cognition/Emotional/Learning Disabilities

- Physical limitations

### Hearing (deaf or hard of hearing)
At this point in time, it is not likely that captions will be available in free or low-priced VR technology. If VR technology is speech heavy or the audio relays essential information or meaning in the VR product, this may be the time to have an alternate product available for the student’s use or perhaps a different product should be used altogether. When reviewing the VR technology (hardware/software) you are considering implementing into the assignment, consider reviewing for the presence of the following items:

- Captions

- Ability to add or use American Sign Language (ASL)

- The types of sounds included in the program:

  - Is there narration that is critical to the meaning of the product?

  - Are there background sounds?

  - Are there sound effects present that add important details to the software?

### Blind or Low Vision
Many VR technologies rely on people’s vision in order to enjoy, participate, or learn from using VR products (Zhao, 2019). Think about the students in your class and if they have any visual limitations. As with students who may have a hearing limitation, those VR products that require students to rely on visual cues may leave students with visual impairments behind (Zhao, 2019).

In addition, VR use can cause nausea, vomiting, eye strain, and headaches (Velicovic, 2021; Saredakis D, et al, 2020; Caddy, B, 2016). Nausea and/or motion sickness in VR can be caused by VR headsets that have what is called high latency, which means taking a long amount of time for the motion from the technology to be detected or perceived by the brain (Caddy B. 2016). In general, the more expensive the equipment, the less latency, and the less side effects it may cause (Liagkou, et al., 2018). Therefore, if it is unknown whether students are susceptible to VR nausea/motion sickness, have students sitting when using the product, start out slow limiting students’ time using the technology, and build up slowly to the amount of time they use can the equipment without side effects.

VR headsets may also be uncomfortable for some students or difficult for other students to wear with glasses depending on the type of headset used. Fortunately, the price for better headsets is starting to decrease. In addition, for those with low vision, VR headsets may enhance the quality of what is seen. To help improve VR for individuals with low vision, Microsoft has created several free to use apps that can significantly improve what students with low vision can see and they can also adjust text to meet their needs! It is open source and free to use (Zhao, 2019). (For more information on these apps go to the SeeingVR website: https://github.com/microsoft/SeeingVRtoolkit/blob/master/LICENSE)

Students who are completely blind may benefit from using haptics (using touch to help determine the size, shape, and movements of objects/scenes in the program) to enjoy or benefit from VR technology (Almedia, 2020). Haptics and VR have successfully been used in nursing training for many years (Butt, 2018). Haptics has also been used in specialized canes to help blind/low vision users maneuver around VR games (Siu, 2020), but very little information can be located that tends to include haptics when using free or low-cost technology.
