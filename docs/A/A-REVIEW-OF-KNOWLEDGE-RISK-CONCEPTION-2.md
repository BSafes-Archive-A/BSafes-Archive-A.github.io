## 2. KNOWLEDGE RISK FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE
### 2.1 Knowledge Risk and Knowledge Risk Management
In the literature, there aren't many definitions of knowledge risk (KR). Bayer and Maier (2006) defined knowledge risk as “an operational risk caused by reliance on, loss of, unsuccessful deliberate or accidental knowledge transfer resources, resulting in nonexclusivity or scarcity of these resources”.

Perrot (2007) defined knowledge risk as “a likelihood of any loss from an event connected with the identification, storage or protection of knowledge that may decrease the operational or strategic benefit of any party involved in the network”. According to Brătianu (2018), knowledge risk refers to any knowledge action performed under uncertainty. He suggests recognizing the likelihood of those events that head to unfavourable outcomes in knowledge management.

The authors of this paper have elected to adhere to the definition of Zieba and Durst (2018) of knowledge risk as “a measure of the probability and severity of adverse effects of any activities engaging or related somehow to knowledge that can affect the functioning of an organization on any level”. This definition is more comprehensive than the one provided by other scholars which are limited to certain types of risks (e.g., knowledge leakage) or certain conditions (e.g., organizational networks).

Knowledge risk management (KRM) is a new concept to managing different risks associated with knowledge that businesses may face (Durst & Zieba, 2020). It combines two previously separate fields: knowledge management and risk management (Massingham, 2010). This study will adopt Durst et al. (2016) definition of KRM as “a systematic activity devoted to the application of a variety of tools and techniques required to detect, examine and react to risks related to the production, usage, and detainment of knowledge”.

### 2.2 Knowledge Risk Perspectives
The term "knowledge risk" refers to a wide range of dangers linked to knowledge that a firm can encounter (Durst *et al*., 2018). There was a lack of knowledge risk perspectives in the existing literature. Jamieson and Loeng (2003) identified several risks associated with knowledge management systems, including the risk of declining organizational creativity and innovation, a lack of end-user buy-in or usage, and the risk of poor knowledge quality. Other risks included a lack of proper knowledge base maintenance, poorly structured knowledge repositories, knowledge theft, poor management of user perception of the usefulness of knowledge management, organizational change and power shifts, and cultural barriers to knowledge transfer.

According to Neef (2005), firms are adopting a mix of risk management and knowledge management procedures and methods. Perrot (2007) emphasized the negative impact of knowledge gap risk on a firm's ability to achieve its goals. Massingham (2010) created a revised knowledge risk management conceptual model that integrates knowledge management tools and strategies into organizational risk management. Trkman and Desouza (2012) investigated the knowledge risk associated with knowledge sharing in network structures.

Knowledge outsourcing risks, knowledge acquisition risks, knowledge continuity risks, and knowledge articulation risks are the four major types of knowledge risk identified by Lambe (2013). Knowledge leakage, knowledge attrition, knowledge loss, knowledge leaking, knowledge concealment, and other knowledge dangers were later added to Lambe's (2013) list by Durst and Zieba (2017).They divided the risks into two groups: internal and external risks. Durst and Zieba (2017) also suggested categorizing the risks based on their source, such as competitors, collaborators, or employees.

Brătianu (2018) proposed that knowledge risk should comprise spiritual, emotional, and rational KR because their effects and significance differ. Durst and Zieba (2018) suggested a knowledge risk map that divides hazards into three categories: human, technological, and operational. Knowledge hoarding, hiding, unlearning and forgetting, and missing/inadequate abilities of organizational members are all human risks.

Cybercrime risks, hazards associated with older technology, risks associated with digitalization, and dangers associated with social media are all part of technological risks (Durst & Zieba, 2018). Whereas merger and acquisition risks, knowledge transfer risk, knowledge acquisition risks, communication risks, continuity risks, espionage, risk of improper knowledge application, risk of using obsolete/unreliable knowledge, knowledge waste, knowledge outsourcing risks, relational risks, and knowledge gaps are all operational risks (Durst & Zieba, 2018). According to Handa et al. (2019), the risks associated with knowledge assets and the risks associated with knowledge capabilities and functions, are the two ways to investigate knowledge risk.

This study is grounded on a thorough examination of the literature so that to comprehend what has been explored about knowledge risk and knowledge risk management so far. The aim is to identify different knowledge risks classifications and to critically discuss and analyse those classifications based on certain criteria such as comprehensiveness, clarity of distinction between different categories and flexibility in accommodating additional risks. Table 1 below outlines various knowledge risk/ knowledge risk management perspectives available in the literature. It will details the authors’ name, journal name, objective of the study, main findings and discussions.
