## ROUTINE ACTIVITY THEORY
While cybercrime and cyberterrorism have become problems of growing importance to our society, little work has been done to address the problem from a theoretical perspective and propose an approach grounded in theory. Overall, very few criminological theories have been applied to crimes in cyberspace. Prior work has been focused on explaining contributing factors to malware victimization (Lévesque et al., 2017), the differences and similarities between physical and cybercrimes (Llinares, 2015), as well as understanding privacy attitudes and safety behaviors online. While these studies add knowledge to this growing field of concern, they are predominantly concerned with attacks against individuals and do not explicitly address critical infrastructure. Cyberterrorism is an inherently difficult to explore due to the sensitive nature of the data and the limited opportunities to collect and analyze it. In addition, the gap in research can be explained by the fact that cyberterrorism is a relatively new concept and there is generally a lack of theoretical frameworks to explain it.

The current study utilizes Routine Activity Theory (RAT) to explain cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and SCADA systems. Others have already used this theory when looking into cybercrimes. For instance, Choo (2011) focused on RAT to mitigate risks and opportunities for cybercrimes to occur through making cybercrime more difficult to commit and by increasing the risks of detection and punishment associated with committing cybercrimes. This paper provides an overview of different types of cybercrimes and proposes mechanisms to prevent them. However, the authors do not go into much depth on the issue of cyberterrorism and how RAT can be used to prevent it.

Clarke and Felson (1993) proposed that a crime occurs when there is a likely offender, a suitable target, and a capable guardian is absent (Figure 1). Routine Activity Theory (RAT) has been developed originally to explain physical crime, but it can be also applied to cyberspace.

In a cyberterrorism context, the likely offender would be any of the nation-states such as China, Russia or North Korea who have the capability to launch APT attacks. A suitable target would be any critical infrastructure like a power grid, a dam, a nuclear facility, etc. Those are any type of facilities of importance to national security that require additional security and have extra layers of protection due to their impact on society. And finally, the absence of a capable guardian would be considered the outdated legacy systems and cleartext protocols used for SCADA systems to communicate between the different components.
