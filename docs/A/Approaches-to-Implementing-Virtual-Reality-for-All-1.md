## Introduction
The potential of using virtual reality (VR) in education has been discussed for many years, but there are still several barriers that prevent educators in both the K-12 and higher education levels from implementing VR in their courses. Many educators do not have access to high-end VR hardware, software, or a programming team to build custom learning experiences and, as a result, they may not be sure how they can utilize VR. Even with access to high-end VR hardware, there are several accessibility considerations to address when planning the effective implementation of VR activities in a course. Even though accessibility is beginning to come to the forefront in the design of VR, there are still improvements to be made (Mott, et al., 2019). This paper will review some practical approaches and strategies that center around the following three main areas of access: accessibility considerations of using VR, access to available technology (hardware and software), and access to free or low-cost VR experiences.
