## 4. Conclusion and Future Scope
When it comes to the Internet of Things networks, security is a major worry that has to be tended to on the off chance that the systems are to be acknowledged and utilized in an assortment of human activity sectors such as commerce and entertainment. With the help of the PUFs-based security protocol, it is possible to identify and authenticate Internet of Things devices. This protocol makes use of interesting keys and timestamps to confirm hubs and messages exchanged interior a particular arrangement.Authentication and identification of Internet of Things devices are two of the most promising technologies that may be utilized to accomplish this. As applied to Internet of Things networks, the approach is constrained in that it requires a considerable sum of computer assets to confirm all of the things, messages, and gadgets within the arrangement, which is restrictively costly. Furthermore, the utilization of a confirmation server may result in the establishment of a bottleneck, which may result in decreased performance.
