## CHAPTER FOUR
### Results
The purpose of my study was to answer the following three questions: 1) What is the relationship between Jewish identity and experiences of antisemitism? 2) What is the relationship between Jewish religious affiliation and experiences of antisemitism? 3) What, if any, type of antisemitism (e.g., ethnically or religiously based antisemitism or anti-Zionism) do Jewish individuals experience most often? In this chapter I will describe the demographic statistics of my sample and will report on the results of the data analyses.

### Participants
As discussed in the previous chapter, the target population for this study was selfidentified Jewish individuals residing in the U.S. who were 18 years or older. A total of 408 individuals participated in the study; 280 individuals completed the first two parts out of three parts of the survey. One participant reported to be under the age of 18, and thus was excluded from the analysis. The final sample included 279 participants. However, 57 of these participants did not complete the third section of the survey. Thus, the final sample used to answer the third question of my dissertation included 222 participants. The final sample was examined for possible outliers by using descriptive statistics frequencies in SPSS; no outliers were found.

#### Demographic Statistics
All participants reported that they identify as Jews. Of the total sample, 121 (43.4%) were male, and 155 (55.6%) were female; the data was missing for three individuals. Out of these participants 60 (21.5%) were in the 18-25 age range, 42 (15.1%) were in the 26-34 age range, 38 (13.6%) were in the 35-44 age range, 53 (19%) were in the 45-54 age range, 49 (17.6%) were in the 55–64 age range, and 34 (12.2%) were over the age of 65. The highest level of education reported by participants was as follows: 2 (0.7%) stated that they had no diploma, 12 (4.3%) stated that they had a high school degree, 32 (11.5%) stated that they had some college, 10 (3.6%) reported that they earned an associate’s degree, 98 (35.1%) had a bachelor’s degree, 67 (24%) had a master’s degree, and 47 (16.8%) had a post-graduate degree. For nine participants this data was not available. Table 1 contains the breakdown of gender, age, and education of the participants.

![Gender, Age & Education Statistics of Sample (N= 279](https://statics.bsafes.com/images/papers/Antisemitism-Today-and-Its-Relationship-to-Jewish-Identity-and-Religious-Denomination-table-1-2.png)



The majority of participants lived in New Jersey and New York, 28.7% and 17.9%, respectively. Other states where respondents indicated that they were from include Arizona 2.2%, California 7.5%, Maine 2.5%, Maryland 3.9%, and Pennsylvania 5.0%. With regard to the type of area in which they live 34.3% of the participants reported living in an urban area, 52% indicated living in a suburban area, and 3.9% marked that they live in a rural area.

#### Data Analysis
After the completion of the data collection the first step was to review the data for missing values. Since the missing values were below 5% and thus considered insignificant, the missing items were retained in the analysis (Heppner et al., 2008). After reviewing the data for missing values, the next step was to determine if the dependent variables religious identity, cultural identity, experiences with antisemitism during the past year, experiences with antisemitism entire life, and level of stress were normally distributed and to examine the means and standard deviations for each of the survey items.

#### Normal Distribution
The histograms for religious identity, cultural identity, and level of stress followed a normal distribution curve with no significant outliers. However, the histograms for the dependent variables antisemitism in the past year and in the entire life revealed a positively skewed distribution for both. According to Salkind and Frey (2019), a positively skewed distribution leans to the left and is considered acceptable when it is less than 1.00. Skewness for antisemitism during the past year and the entire life was 2.22 and 1.27, respectively. Thus, a log transformation was necessary for both dependent variables. Log transformations are used to change greatly skewed distributions into less skewed distributions (Lane et al., n.d.). The application of log transformations helps to meet the assumptions of inferential statistics (Lane et al., n.d.). After applying the log transformations in my study, skewness for antisemitism during the past year decreased from 2.22 to 1.32. The skewness distribution for experiences with antisemitism the entire life decreased from 1.269 to .418, and thus meets the assumptions of inferential statistics.

#### Correlation
Since this study examined the relationship between dependent variables, confounding variables, and independent variables, a preliminary correlation analysis was implemented. The correlation matrix revealed that none of the predictor variables were highly correlated with each other. This indicates that each predictor variable has an independent effect on the dependent variable (Heppner et al., 2008). In addition, the correlation matrix showed that the predictor variables had a statistically significant correlation with the dependent variables and with two (age and education) of the three confounding variables. The confounding variable gender was dropped from the regression analyses because it did not have a significant relationship with the dependent variable.

#### Multicollinearity
The next step was to test for collinearity. In general, multicollinearity occurs when two independent variables in the same analysis are highly correlated (.70 or more; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). To determine multicollinearity, it is important to look at the variance of inflation (VIF). A value of tolerance higher than 0.2 with a simultaneous value of VIF of 10 or above indicates the multicollinearity is not significant (Statistics Solutions, 2019). In the present study all of the values of tolerance were higher than 0.2 and the value of the VIFs was lower than 10.

#### Variables
The first research question of my study analyzed the relationship between Jewish identity (religious and ethnic) and experiences with antisemitism. The independent variable Jewish identity (ethnic and religious) and the dependent variables experiences with antisemitism were used to examine this relationship.

*Jewish identity* was measured with the American Jewish Identity Scale (AJIS). The AJIS contains two subscales, religious identity (RI) and cultural identity (CI). Higher scores on both of the subscales signified a stronger RI and CI. The standard deviation for RI was 14.32. The mean score for RI was 46.26 with scores ranging from 19 to 76. A mean score of 46.26 equates to an average score of 2.47 per item. This suggests that the average participant reported that the questions related to religious practices were a little to fairly true for them. The standard deviation for CI was 7.65 with scores ranging from 15 to 56. The mean score for CI was 43.51; this equates to an average score of 3.11per item. This suggests that the average participant reported that the questions about cultural identity were fairly true for them.

*Experiences with antisemitism* was measured by means of an adapted version of the General Ethnic Discrimination (GED) scale and is comprised of three subscales. Higher scores signify more experiences with antisemitism during the past year (HOPY), the entire life (HOEL), and a higher level of stress (HS). The standard deviation for the level of stress was 19.67. The mean score for HS was 42.41, with scores ranging from 17 to 96. A mean score of 42.41 equates to an average score of 2.5 per item, which indicates a light to moderate stress level. The standard deviation for HOPY was 9.6. The mean score for this subscale was 24.17, which equates to an average score of 1.42 per item, which suggests that participants never or once in a while experienced antisemitism during the past year.

The third subscale measured antisemitic experiences during the participant’s entire life. The standard deviation for HOEL was 10.55 and the mean score was 30.95, which equates to an average score of 1.82 per item, which indicates that participants never or once in a while experienced antisemitism during their entire life. Overall, it appears that participants in this sample faced few antisemitic occurrences. However, the majority of participants (96.1%) reported that they had experienced antisemitism in their life. This is evidenced by the fact that only 11 out of 279 participants chose the response option “never” to all of the questions of the GED when they had the following response options: “never,” “once in a while,” “sometimes,” “a lot,” “most of the time,” and “almost all the time.” This suggests that most Jewish individuals are exposed to antisemitism at some point in their life. Table 2 presents participants’ mean scores as well as the standard deviation for the AJIS and the GED.

The second research question examined the relationship between membership with one of the Jewish denominations and experiences with antisemitism. More specifically, the purpose of the second question was to assess if there is a relationship between Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox Jews vis-à-vis experiences with antisemitism.

*Religious denomination* was determined with the help of the following survey question: “Which of the following comes closest to describing your current Jewish identity?” With regard to religious affiliation, 19% of the participants indicated that they were members of a Reform synagogue, 39% indicated that they were members of a Conservative synagogue, and 20.9% reported that they were members of an Orthodox synagogue. In addition, 8.2% identified themselves as being part of another stream of Judaism, and 11.9% reported no affiliation at all. The reported religious affiliations are inconsistent with other studies about Jewish affiliations in the U.S. For instance, a Pew study from 2013 indicated that 35% of the participants reported being part of the Reform movement and 18% reported to be part of the Conservative movement, while 10% reported being Orthodox (Lipka, 2013). The differences in percentages of religious affiliation may be attributed to the use of convenience and snowball sampling. Table 3 contains the breakdown of religious affiliation.

My third question addressed the type of antisemitism Jewish individuals experience most often. The goal was to determine whether participants experienced antisemitism based on ethnicity, religion, or anti-Israel attitudes most often. To answer this question participants were asked to rate on a scale from one to three (least often, often, most often) which one of the three types of antisemitism they experienced most. As mentioned, 96% of the participants in this study reported that they have experienced some type of antisemitism.

The *type of antisemitism* that was reported as experienced most often was anti-Zionism (42.8%), closely followed by religiously based antisemitism (37.4%), and ethnically based antisemitism (19.8%). The results for least experienced form of antisemitism followed a similar pattern: Participants reported that they had experienced religiously based antisemitism (43.2%) the least often, followed by anti-Zionism (38.7), and followed by ethnically based antisemitism (18%). The type of antisemitism experienced often followed a reversed pattern compared to antisemitism experienced most often and least often. The analysis of the data revealed that 62% of the participants experienced ethnically based antisemitism often, followed by 19.4% who reported that they had experienced religiously based antisemitism often. Lastly, 18.5% reported that they had experienced anti-Zionism often. Figure 1 presents a histogram of the type of antisemitism that was experienced most often, often, and least often.

### Results

#### Correlation Analysis
 The purpose of the first question of my study was to determine the relationship between Jewish identity (independent variable) and HS, HOPY, HOEL (dependent variables), as well as the relationship between religious denomination (independent variable) and HS, HOPY, HOEL (dependent variable). To determine if there was a relationship between the various independent variables and dependent variables, I ran a Pearson correlation analysis. Table 4 presents the output of the significant correlations.

*Output of correlations*

![Output of correlations](https://statics.bsafes.com/images/papers/Antisemitism-Today-and-Its-Relationship-to-Jewish-Identity-and-Religious-Denomination-table-4.png)

I found a few variables that had a significant correlation. Age of the respondent had a significant positive correlation with HOPY *r* = 0.175, *p* < .01. The level of education had a significant negative correlation to antisemitism HOPY *r* = -0.231, *p* < .01. Education also had a significant negative correlation to HOEL *r* = 0.125, *p* < .05. Cultural identity had a significant positive correlation to HS *r* = 0.211, *p* < .01. Moreover, cultural identity had a significant positive correlation to HOPY *r* = 0.137, *p* < .05 as well as a significant positive correlation to HOEL e *r* = 0.192, *p* < .01. Religious identity had a significant positive relationship to HOPY *r* = 0.145, *p* < .05. No significant correlations were found between religious affiliation and HS or HOEL.

### Multiple Linear Regression
To get a better understanding of the unique contributions of each of the predictor variables (Jewish ethnic and cultural identity, Jewish affiliation) on the dependent variables (HS, HOPY, HOEL) a series of multiple linear regressions was conducted. The first research question was: What is the relationship between Jewish identity and experiences of antisemitism? The  results of the multiple linear regression supported that cultural identity had a significant positive relationship with HS. The regression analysis contained the confounding variables age, gender, and education, the dependent variable HS, and the independent variables cultural identity and religious identity. The model was significant as evidenced by F(5, 256) = 3.262, p<.05. The adjusted R2 of .042 signifies that 4.2% of the variance of the dependent variable level of stress is explained by the independent variable cultural identity. The second regression was based on the same confounding and independent variables. The dependent variable was HOPY. This model was not significant as evidenced by F(5,256) = 5.049, p<.07. The third regression with the dependent variable experiences with HOEL was significant. This is evidenced by F(5, 256) =3.031, p<.05. The adjusted R2 of .037 indicates that cultural identity explained 3.7% of the variance of HOEL.

The second question was: “What is the relationship between Jewish religious affiliation and experiences of antisemitism?” To answer this question additional variables were added to the previous regression models. This analysis contained the confounding variables gender, age, and education as well as cultural identity and religious identity. The independent variable was religious affiliation, for which I created two dummy variables. The dependent variables were HS, HOPY, HOEL. I chose affiliation with a Reform synagogue as the benchmark group against which I compared affiliation with either a Conservative or an Orthodox synagogue. Reform Judaism was chosen as the benchmark group as current statistics indicate that Reform Judaism is the affiliation with the most members (Lipka, 2013).

The multiple regression model with the dependent variable HS was significant, F(7, 254)=3.085, p.05 for cultural identity and religious denominations. The adjusted R2 of .053 suggests that 5.3% of the variance of HS can be explained by cultural identity. The coefficient matrix indicates that cultural identity is significantly, positively albeit weakly correlated to HS (ß = .212). Furthermore, the matrix shows that there is a significant weak relationship for Orthodox Jews suggesting that Orthodox Jews experience antisemitic incidents as less stressful than Reform Jews (ß = -.223). The correlation for Conservative membership was not significant. However, it appears that Conservative Jews also experience antisemitic incidents as less stressful than Reform Jews (ß = -.092).

The following regression model with the previously mentioned predictor variables and the dependent variable HOPY was significant and produced F(7,254)=5.017, p.05. The adjusted R2 of .097 suggests 9.7% of the variance for HOPY is explained by education, religious identity, and religious affiliation. The coefficient matrix shows that education is negatively weakly correlated to HOPY (ß = -.218) and religious identity is positively, moderately correlated to HOPY (ß = .304). This suggests that individuals with a higher education experience less HOPY and individuals with a stronger religious identity experienced more HOPY than individuals with weaker religious identities. Additionally, there appears to be a significant negative, weak relationship for Orthodox (ß = -.276) and Conservative (ß = -.163) membership compared to Reform membership with regard to HOPY. This implies that both Orthodox and Conservative individuals experienced less antisemitism during the last year compared to Reform Jews.

The last regression model I conducted used the same predictor variables and the dependent variable HOEL. The regression model suggests that the regression is significant F(7,254)=2.955, p.01. The adjusted R2 .05 suggests 5% of the variance for HOEL is explained by education. A closer look at the coefficient table reveals that there is a significant weak, negative relationship between education (ß = -.155) and HOEL, and significant, weak, negative relationship between HOEL and Orthodox (ß = -.217) membership when compared to Reform membership. These findings suggest that Orthodox Jews were exposed less often to HOEL compared to Reform Jews. The relationship for Conservative Jews was not significant. However, it appears that Conservative Jews similar to Orthodox Jews were exposed less often to HOEL then Reform Jews.

#### Summary of Results
This chapter presented the results of the data analysis I conducted to answer my three research questions. The data was collected via an online survey between December 2018 and September 2019 and is based on the answers of 279 self-identified Jews about their experiences with antisemitism. Participants were well educated (75.9% had a bachelors or a higher degree).

The multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the predictor variables cultural identity, religious identity, and religious affiliation were statistically significant. Participants with a higher cultural identity experienced more antisemitism over their entire life and a higher level of stress compared to participants with a weaker cultural identity. Participants with a higher religious identity experienced more antisemitism over the past year compared to individuals with a weaker religious identity. Denomination played an important role in predicting experiences with antisemitism. Orthodox and Conservative Jews experienced significantly less antisemitism over the past year compared to Reform Jews. Moreover, Orthodox Jews experienced significantly less antisemitism over their entire life and experienced antisemitic incidents as less stressful than Reform Jews. The implications of the results for counselor educators and licensed mental health counselors will be discussed in the next chapter.
