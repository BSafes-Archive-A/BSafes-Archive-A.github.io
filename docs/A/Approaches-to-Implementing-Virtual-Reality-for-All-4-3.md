## Software Considerations
As you search for VR experiences that meet your learning goals, there are several software considerations to keep in mind such as cost, accessibility features, hardware requirements, access, and privacy. Some VR experiences are freely available and don’t require students to create accounts to access, while others require students to create an account or pay (e.g., VR mobile application) to access. Whenever students are required to create an account for a third-party tool or install an app on their personal mobile device, privacy should be considered. A few questions to answer when selecting VR software are provided below.

- Is the VR content free to students? 
    - If so, will students need to create an account and login to access the free content? 
    - If students need to create an account, review the privacy policy. 

- Does the web-based VR experience provide accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation with arrow keys)? 
    - The website or help guide for the VR content may or may not provide information regarding accessibility features.
- Does the VR content provide options for viewing (e.g., view on a laptop via a browser, view in VR mode on a mobile device while using a VR headset)? 
    - What hardware is required for students to view the VR content?
