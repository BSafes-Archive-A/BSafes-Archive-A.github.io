## Introduction
In 2017, various sources (most notably from the private-sector) announced the foundations of a new megacity project in the Philippines —The City of Pearl.1 Named after the antiquated nickname for Manila as “the pearl of the orient,” this proposed urban center is set to be anything but a reminder of the past. Purportedly hosting the likes of golf courses, sports stadiums, and high rises—all intertwined with artificial intelligence creating a “smart city.”<sup>2</sup> The project was set to involve 407 hectares of mostly reclaimed land off the bay of Manila. Though the project is by no means unilateral, the chief architectural firm regarding its construction is Hong Kong-based company—Ho and Partners Architects Engineers & Development Consultants Limited. Meanwhile, the chief construction firm is UAA Kinming Development Corporation, a Manila-based company created solely for the city's development, but with heavy involvement from the Hong Kong-based Kho Group and a “major Chinese state-owned conglomerate named ‘mother company.’” <sup>3</sup>

A similar incipit project in the Philippines is that of New Clark City, a green-smart megacity of similar scale to The City of Pearl but without any focus on land reclamation or coastal proximity. <sup>4</sup> Though these two projects are not exclusively funded through Chinese sources, they may easily be considered as extensions of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Since their respective unveilings, the level of development regarding both projects has underperformed expectations, inviting worry from observers. These sentiments may be stemming from the rapid development of projects in the same vicinity, such as Forest City Johor in Malaysia or International City in Sri Lanka.

Despite differences in levels of development, lead architect of The City of Pearl, Nicholas Ho, has stated that it is his goal to complete the city "in seven phases over 20 years.” <sup>5</sup> With longer timetables, worry regarding stagnation and falling short on benchmarks when compared to other BRI projects become less salient. Though maritime disputes and worries regarding employment have created tension between Manila and Beijing in recent years, bilateral agreements in the name of investment and development reign strong between the two nations as cooperation accelerates.

Ever extending cooperation between China and the Philippines may foster fears that relations between the United States and the Philippines are set to deteriorate. Relations between the two countries had certainly begun to sour within the past decade, with one prominent example being the attempted annulment of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) by the Duterte administration. <sup>6</sup> The claim that this potential annulment signifies a major pivot away from the United States and towards China is reductive, however. The immense history that the Philippines and the United States share as allies and current linkages of cooperation may serve to bolster their mutual friendship. As the grandiosity of Philippine-US relations carries profound implications on both countries, it is imperative that the United States engage further with such matters, rather than pursuing a more distant approach.
