## Conclusion
As presented in this paper, access to low-cost VR hardware and software has increased, making it easier for educators to utilize this technology with students. While this technology will continue to evolve, the accessibility considerations presented in this article will remain relevant. In addition to considering accessibility, it is important to also remain focused on the learning goals and purpose for including VR in the curriculum rather than first focusing on the technology. Testing the technology with accessibility in mind and intentionally designing the learning experiences are key. Once appropriate VR technologies have been identified and meaningful learning experiences have been designed, all students, including those with special needs, can engage with and benefit from the use of VR.
