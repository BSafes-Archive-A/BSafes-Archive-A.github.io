## METHODOLOGY
The current study utilizes Design Science Research (DSR) methods. This approach is appropriate because it addresses real-world problems of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure through an academic lens and provides a solution that is grounded in research (Hevner & Chatterjee, 2010; Hevner et al., 2004). More specifically, DSR has three cycles, and they are addressed as follows:

- Rigor cycle – an extensive literature review was completed to inform the initial design of the taxonomy. 

- Relevance cycle – requirements were derived from the gap in knowledge, skills, and technology that currently exists in the critical infrastructure facilities and the information security professionals who maintain them.

- Design cycle – the taxonomy was initially created based on analyzing academic work, but it was validated and refined through simulations and then we will conduct qualitative interviews with practitioners in the field who are the target of the proposed tool.

To evaluate the taxonomy, we used three scenarios that are based on real-world cyberattacks. These scenarios are informed from publicly available data on prior attacks such as Stuxnet, the Ukrainian power grid shut down, and numerous ransomware attacks against public institutions in the US. The purpose of initially testing the taxonomy with simulations is to evaluate it and document the lessons learned or suggestions for improvement before taking the next step and evaluating it through interviews with practitioners in the field. The themes that emerge from testing the taxonomy with the scenarios can be used to inform the development of empirical generalizations and, in turn, theory to explain cyberattacks against critical infrastructure facilities. The results can help refine the proposed taxonomy and evaluate its utility and usability for practitioners in the field who encounter various cyberattacks and do not have adequate mechanisms to provide effective and efficient guardianship.

The sensitive nature of this project presents a significant challenge to identifying participants and collecting the data. Thus, we created simulations based on publicly available data on cyberterrorist attacks. While the current study predominantly explores the problem from a US-centered perspective, cybercrimes and cyberterrorism are global issues and our methodological approach can be replicated in other countries.

To operationalize the proposed taxonomy, the first step is to explore and explain scenarios that are based on real-world cyberattacks against critical infrastructure facilities. That way can avoid any issues with obtaining access to sensitive topsecret government information. The second part of this project includes conducting a pilot test with several college level students with basic understanding of the topic. They are presented with the taxonomy and the three scenarios and are asked to classify the attacks. This will help to understand whether the taxonomy is easy to use and understand and whether it provides exhaustive information on each of the dimensions.
