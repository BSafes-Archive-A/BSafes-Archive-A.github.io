## History of Philippine-U.S. Relations
Initially colonized by the Spanish Empire in the 16th century under the rule of King Philip II (hence the namesake), the Philippine Islands had its ownership transferred to the United States of America following the Spanish-American war of 1898. <sup>7</sup> Rather than holistically taking the Philippines as “spoils of war,” the United States purchased the islands and eliminated the nascent republic that had formed in the short period following Spain's absence. The Philippines would remain a colony of the United States until after the conclusion of World War II in 1946. Though the United States and the Philippines presently support bilateral cooperation, the treatment of the Philippines as an American colony was largely one of exploitation, marring prospects for development.

Examples of this exploitation include an emphasis on profitability for individuals of American origin at the expense of Filipino natives, stamping out calls for democracy, and utilizing a media campaign that “defin[ed] Filipino identity as savage”. <sup>8</sup> It is impossible to undo the adversity inflicted on the Philippines by colonial practices, but it is not only possible—yet also advisable—for the prospects of bilateral cooperation that future measures placate the wellbeing of the people of the Philippines as well. Following the nation's independence in 1946, Manila and Washington formed an alliance that was contingent upon mutual defense.<sup>9</sup> The 1951 Mutual Defense Agreement (MDA) between the two countries, affirming that one would support the other if an attack was to take place, solidified the alliance between the two nations. <sup>10</sup> Against the backdrop of the Cold War, where the specter of war was ever prominent, the MDA cemented the Philippines as not only a U.S. ally —but a close one. The MDA remains in place today, with its resilience serving as an analog for the resilience of friendship between the two nations. Despite being signed over 70 years ago, the MDA carries prominence to today with Anthony Blinken under the Biden administration vocally reaffirming U.S. commitment to the agreement in 2021. <sup>11</sup>

In regards to economics, the Philippines Statistics Authority shows that yearly investment from the United States has fluctuated within the past 10 years, peaking at roughly $80 billion under the Obama administration, dropping to figures ranging from $10 billion to $30 billion under the Trump administration, and now surpassing the $30 billion figure with an upward trajectory under the Biden administration. <sup>12</sup> Meanwhile, according to data concerning foreign trade on census.gov, annual exports to the Philippines have hovered near $8 billion and annual imports have risen from $9 billion to $12 billion since 2011 to 2020; figures in 2021 were $9 billion for exports and $14 billion for imports, revealing another upward trend. <sup>13</sup> The presence of the United States as a large stakeholder in the Philippine economy as well as trends of increasing investment highlight the importance of cooperation between the two countries. These factors also underline the current outlook of increased interaction between the two countries. However, the emergence of China in the Belt and Road Initiative may come to rival the United States’ place.
