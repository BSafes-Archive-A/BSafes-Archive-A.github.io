This is an auspicious time to call for a new compact for sexual privacy. Dozens upon dozens of privacy bills are under consideration at the federal and state levels. Privacy law reform should provide special protections for intimate information to protect the values that sexual privacy secures and to prevent certain harms to people’s well-being, including their ability to work, study, get loans, obtain insurance, and find housing. Those protections should include limitations on collection and the recognition of no-collection zones. We should widen the available remedies to include injunctive relief. This Article aims to begin the conversation about why a new compact for sexual privacy is needed and how we might go about doing that.
