## Abstract 
Knowledge is regarded as a critical source of sustainable competitive advantage. However, knowledge has a negative aspect as well. Organizations face a variety of risks as a result of a lack of knowledge, its disappearance, incorrect application, or other consequences of knowledge-related use. Various knowledge risk dimensions were reported in the literature. The authors summarized and analyzed the theoretical perspectives on knowledge risks based on certain criteria such as comprehensiveness, clarity and flexibility. This research has provided an extended knowledge risk taxonomy of Durst and Zieba (2018). The taxonomy now includes a strategic knowledge risks group that embraces knowledge loss, knowledge leakage, and knowledge gaps risks. This type of knowledge risks has long-term severe impacts on organizational performance and must be managed by senior management/executives. Further research shall be conducted to empirically test and validate the proposed taxonomy.

## Keywords 
Knowledge, knowledge risk, knowledge management, knowledge risk management
